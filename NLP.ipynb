    "# 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section loads the dataset from a CSV file and prepares it for the models. Proper preprocessing is crucial for model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Load Data**: Reads `merged_sentiments.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "2.  **Clean Column Names**: `df.columns.str.strip()` removes any accidental leading or trailing whitespace from the column names (e.g., changing `\" sentiment \"` to `\"sentiment\"`).\n",
    "3.  **Clean Text Data**:\n",
    "    - A new column `statement_clean` is created.\n",
    "    - The text in the `statement` column is first converted to a string type using `.astype(str)` to prevent errors with non-text data (like empty cells).\n",
    "    - It's then converted to lowercase using `.str.lower()` to ensure words like \"Good\" and \"good\" are treated as the same.\n",
    "4.  **Map Labels to Integers**: Machine learning models work with numbers, not text labels. A `label_map` is created to convert `{'negative': 0, 'neutral': 1, 'positive': 2}`.\n",
    "5.  **Handle Missing Labels**: The code checks for and drops any rows where the sentiment label could not be mapped, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "6.  **Split Data**: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.\n",
    "    - `random_state=42` ensures the split is the same every time.\n",
    "    - `stratify=y` is very important: it ensures that the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative samples is the same in both the training and testing sets, which prevents the model from being evaluated on an unrepresentative test set."

    "\n",
    "This section builds, trains, and evaluates a Bidirectional LSTM model for multi-class sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Tokenization and Padding**:\n",
    "    - **Tokenizer**: A `Tokenizer` is created to convert words into integer IDs. `num_words=10000` limits the vocabulary to the 10,000 most common words. `oov_token=\"<OOV>\"` assigns a special token for words not in the vocabulary.\n",
    "    - **Padding**: Sentences have different lengths, but neural networks require fixed-size inputs. `pad_sequences` is used to make every sequence `120` tokens long by adding zeros (`padding='post'`) or cutting off words (`truncating='post'`).\n",
    "2.  **Build the LSTM Model**:\n",
    "    - `Sequential`: A linear stack of layers.\n",
    "    - `Embedding`: This layer learns a dense vector representation (an \"embedding\") for each word in the vocabulary. Here, each word is mapped to a 32-dimensional vector.\n",
    "    - `Bidirectional(LSTM(64))`: This is the core of the model. An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) excellent at learning from sequences. Wrapping it in `Bidirectional` allows the network to process the sequence both forwards and backwards, which often improves context understanding.\n",
    "    - `Dense`: Standard fully-connected neural network layers.\n",
    "    - `Dense(3, activation='softmax')`: The final output layer. It has **3 units** (one for each class: negative, neutral, positive) and uses the **softmax** activation function, which outputs a probability distribution across the classes.\n",
    "3.  **Compile the Model**:\n",
    "    - `loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy'`: This is the correct loss function for multi-class classification when the true labels are integers (like 0, 1, 2).\n",
    "    - `optimizer='adam'`: A standard, effective optimization algorithm.\n",
    "4.  **Train and Evaluate**:\n",
    "    - The model is trained for 30 `epochs` (passes over the training data).\n",
    "    - `validation_data` is used to monitor performance on the test set after each epoch.\n",
    "    - The final predictions are obtained using `np.argmax`, which selects the class with the highest probability from the softmax output.\n",
    "    - The results are displayed with an accuracy score, a detailed classification report, and a visual confusion matrix."

    "# 4. Model 2: Transformer (DistilBERT) + Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This section uses a much more powerful, pre-trained Transformer model called **DistilBERT**. Instead of training a deep network from scratch, we use DistilBERT to generate high-quality numerical representations (embeddings) of the text, and then train a simple classifier on these embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach?**\n",
    "- Transformer models like BERT are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, giving them a deep understanding of language, grammar, and context.\n",
    "- This technique, called **transfer learning**, allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results with much less data and training time than building from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Load Pre-trained Model**: `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModel` from Hugging Face are used to download and load `distilbert-base-uncased`, a smaller, faster version of BERT. `.to(device)` moves the model to the GPU for acceleration.\n",
    "2.  **Generate Embeddings**:\n",
    "    - The `get_bert_embeddings` function takes a list of sentences.\n",
    "    - It tokenizes them using the BERT tokenizer and feeds them into the model.\n",
    "    - For each sentence, we extract the embedding of the special `[CLS]` token (the first token in the sequence), which is designed to be a summary representation of the entire sentence.\n",
    "    - These embeddings (768-dimensional vectors) are generated for both the training and testing sets.\n",
    "3.  **Train a Classifier**:\n",
    "    - A simple `LogisticRegression` model from scikit-learn is trained on the generated embeddings. This classifier learns to map the 768-dimensional embedding vectors to the sentiment labels (0, 1, 2).\n",
    "4.  **Evaluate**: The trained classifier is evaluated on the test set embeddings, and its performance is reported."

The GMP of Hyundai Motor shares have dropped from its peak of ₹570 on September 27 to ₹165 on October 10, indicating the listing price to be around ₹2,125, a premium of 8.4% over the issue price. The GMP has witnessed sharp correction in three sessions, from ₹270 on October 7 to ₹147 on October 8, after the auto major announced the price band for its upcoming IPO at ₹1,865-1,960 per share. The drop in the GMP of Hyundai Motor shares can be attributed to its “rich valuations” coupled with volatility in the domestic equity market amid escalated geo-political tensions.Hyundai Motor India is seeking a slightly higher premium to Maruti and lower to M&M based on price earnings ratio while the company stands to be expensive in terms of price to book value. Hyundai India justifies its premium ask considering its leadership in SUV sales, world class brand image followed by better safety ratings, multi segment growth visibility largely been driven by its popular SUVs, particularly the Creta, Exter, and Venue models in the Indian market,” says Tapse.On valuation perse based on annualised FY25e expectation the issue appears fully priced-in leaving no room for any healthy listing gain,” he adds.Despite contributing only 6.5% of Hyundai's global revenues and 8% of its profitability, Hyundai’s India is asking for premium valuation even when compared to its South Korean parent entity, Hyundai Motor Group, which is trading at 5-6-time price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and valued 42% of the South Korean parent's market capitalisation on listing.Despite global headwinds and domestic inventory pressure, the country’s largest-ever IPO is eagerly awaited by investors and is expected to garner good response when it opens for subscription on October 15.Domestic brokerage Anand Rathi has recommended “Subscribe – Long Term” rating to the IPO, saying that HMIL has consistently held the position as the leading auto OEM in India by sales volume in the mid-size SUV sub-segment from Fiscal Year 2019 through the three months ending on June 30, 2024\"\n",
