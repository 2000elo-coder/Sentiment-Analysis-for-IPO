Reddit,canara robeco ipo,"Young investor looking for SIP fund suggestions and split advice I’m currently young and single, with minimal expenses and no financial dependents. That gives me a decent amount of flexibility when it comes to investing. I’m planning to allocate a good portion of my salary into SIPs.

I’m thinking of dividing the investment across large cap, mid cap, small cap, and index funds. Since I’m in a position to take on a bit more risk, I’m considering putting around 20% into higher-risk funds, but I’m not sure if that’s the right approach.

The plan is to revisit this in let's say 7-8 years of time where in I can continue the SIP but maybe reduce the amounts as and when there are other financial dependencies.

Some of the most common suggestions I have read regarding the funds are:  
Large Cap - Motilal Oswal fund, ICICI Prudential  
Mid Cap - Motilal Oswal, HDFC  
Small Cap - Nippon India, Canara Robeco, Quant, SBI  
Multi Cap - Nippon India, HDFC FlexiCap, JM Flexicap, Parag Parikh Flexicap  
Index Fund - Nifty 50, Nifty Midcap 150, Nifty 500

Suggestions stated to use Direct plan instead of regular plan, although I am not really aware of the difference

Reddit,canara robeco ipo,"Long term conviction/thesis for my stock picks All my holdings are LONG TERM only. I started serious direct stock investing from around March this year (so my returns look decent because of the run up since then). It represents 1/3rd of my total portfolio (1/3rd in MFs and 1/3rd in US equity). My goal is simple:- to buy and hold cash flow compounding machines for a long time.

Apar Industries - it was trading at a 52 week low and they were making high quality export level products. Now facing uncertainities due to tariffs.

Nuvama Wealth - major player in a fast growing sector of wealth management. Growing top line consistently at ~20% comprising mostly sticky recurring revenue. All this available at a PE of 24 and PEG < 1. Still a good buy imp, but a lot of competition in this sector.

Swiggy - I foolishly thought having everything in one platform might make customer acquisition cheaper and easier. But they are being out-executed by Zomato in every turn. I still believe this stock has more upside but not adding more.

PFC - Consistent compounder trading just about book value. Lending majorly to discoms so NPA isn't too high and growing revenue around 20%. Looking to add more as I see more growth due government push for capex and RBI's liquidity norms. I also see long term secular tailwinds for India's energy sector. (Plus div yield of 4%)

KPI Green - Growing top line at >50% and bottom line at 100% with PE of 30 in a sector with a lot of tailwinds such as renewables. No idea why this stock is so cheap. Looking to add more.

CAMS - a bet on increasing financialization of India and growth of SIPs in India. Trying toadd more toll gate businesses like this in my portfolio. Strong moat, dominant position in a duopoly with high switching costs. But growth is slowing and is not enough to sustain its current valuation.

CARE Ratings - again a low capex, high margin toll gate business with high barriers to entry. Credit rating agencies globally are considered one of the best businesses to own and always trade at a premium. Care Ratings is the fastest growing and cheapest rating agency in India so it was a no brainer. It is also backed by super investor Guy Spier.

PVR Inox - it is a turn around between. I believe movies are an integral part of India's growing out culture. And PVR Inox is a virtual monopoly in this space. But it is still a risky bet with a shaky balance sheet and shite quality of Indian movies today.

Coal India - monopoly in the coal space and available at a stupidly cheap valuation. High dividend yield. But margins depend on global coal prices.

Pricol - a monopoly in the instrument cluster space for two wheelers. I believe betting on two wheelers is safer than the auto space in India. Pricol is growing at almost 20% and I may add more if valuation stays or dips slightly.

Canara bank - trading below book value with decent growth in NII, low NPAs and high dividend yield. Looking to add more.

Stocks I am looking to add more in - KPI Green, Canara bank, Nuvama, Care Ratings, PFC.

Stocks I may exit after a year - Apar, Swiggy, Nestle, KEI.

Current Watchlist - NSDL (if it gets to IPO price), TD power systems (if it gets to 350-400 levels and tarrif concers are allayed), MCX (waiting for a dip), Adani Ports (due to the monopoly nature), Narayana Hrudalaya, Dr Agarwal's Healthcare.",1755929554.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxtsft

Reddit,canara robeco ipo,"Advice on MF Investments Hey folks, 25M here earning around 1.12L per month net of TDS. I intend to invest around 60,000 through SIP per month including 10,000 in liquid funds. 

Have been investing through SIP and few direct equity investments too for the last couple of years. Started SIP with 6000 monthly, raised to 10000 and then 20000. Now moving to 60000. Not sure whether it is too aggressive or not. Happy to hear your thoughts. 

I had thought of this, on the advice from someone I know in the wealth management space. Let me know your views of if any tweaks are needed here. Here’s the name and allocation - 

Kotak Emerging Equity Fund - 8.33%
Nippon India Multicap Fund - 8.33%
Canara Robeco Emerging Equities Fund - 8.33%
HDFC Liquid Fund - 8.33%
Nippon India Flexicap Fund - 16.67%
HDFC Corporate Bond Fund - 16.67%
ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund - 16.67%
Nippon India Smallcap Fund - 8.33%
HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund - 8.33%

Didn't want to overindex on one brand or strategy so have divided. Also bond fund is more of a safety investment not a growth investment, just keeping it liquid.

Alternatively, should i be doing ETFs instead of bluechip funds? Not very sure of this point but read it somewhere. Should i increase or decrease allocations or remove/add funds?

Doing a small investment in Gold and Silver too through Goldbees and Silverbees.

Aim:

To find the long term performance of flexi cap direct growth funds which are at least 10 years old compared to a few Nifty indices.

Data Sources:

1. [amfiindia](https://www.amfiindia.com)
2. [niftyindices](https://niftyindices.com)

Data Period:

29 April 2014 - 20 Dec 2024

Note:

1. Indices are of the total returns variant.
2. Nifty indices data may contain backtested data.
3. Sorted by median.

**Thoughts**:

*Due to the short period of data that is available for the analysis due to direct funds not being in existence for long, I'd personally rely on the 5-year rolling returns for the longer term performance of each fund/index but look at the 7-year rolling returns to judge how the fund/index has been performing for a while now.*

**Rolling Returns**

>Rolling return is calculated for a particular period continuously (or fixed frequency). Simply put, it is like calculating trailing returns daily.

>Let’s understand with an example. Suppose we want to see the 5-year return of a fund over the 10 years between 2010 to 2020. So, the rolling return would mean calculating the 5-year return on each day during this period.

>You will calculate the 5-year return as of 1st January 2010, 2nd January 2010, and so on till 31st December 2020. It will show you a spread of returns had you invested on any day during this period (2010 to 2020) for 5 years.

>One of the biggest advantages of rolling returns is that by looking at the range of returns, you can understand what kind of returns the fund has delivered for the period you are planning to invest in it. And in some way, you can understand the probability of earning such returns going forward.

I've decided to invest ₹20,000 per month, split equally between 4 mutual funds, so ₹5,000 in each one. My current portfolio consists of one large-cap, one mid-cap, one small-cap, and one index fund:

* ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund - ₹5,000
* Quant small cap fund - ₹5,000
* Kotak Emerging Equity Fund - ₹5,000
* UTI Nifty 50 Index fund - ₹5,000

I have a few questions:

1. Is this portfolio good enough, or should I make some changes? If yes what changes should I make.
2. Should I continue investing in ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund? While its returns are good, the expense ratio is 0.87%, which feels high to me. The alternatives I choose for this are Canara Robeco Bluechip fund, Nippon India Large cap fund.
3. Quant small cap fund has good returns, but I started this SIP recently, and it p&l has been consistently in the negative, while ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund showed good returns within a month.

I always invested backing everything with solid research which led to me investing in defence, ship building, infrastructure, railways, EV related stocks towards mid 2023, it felt like the government's long term vision would be focused on these sectors. However, YOLO kicked in and I went on a buying spree for a little bit, hence the massive number of holdings XD. I have a long term outlook with occasional profit booking.

Reddit,canara robeco ipo,"Is one mutual fund per category still good advice? (thinking after the Axis front running case) I've been a mutual fund investor for 5 years and always stuck to the advice of investing in 1 fund per category.

I've been thinking lately if this is the right approach.

Here's why:

I used to invest in 1 index fund, 1 mid-cap, and 1 small-cap fund. The small-cap fund of choice is Axis Small Cap Fund.

After the front running case, I stopped my SIP with Axis and slowly moved to Canara Robeco Small Cap Fund.

During the process:

1. I realized you cannot trust 1 fund house per category then why should you only keep 1 fund per category
2. I noticed the portfolio overlap between the 2 funds wasn't much at all. So isn't it better to own 2 funds per category provided they don't have much overlap (< 25%) given it's for long-term investment (10+ years)

So, I've been left thinking if I should instead have: 1 index fund + 1 index ETF, 2 mid-cap funds, and 2 small-cap funds for the sake of diversification and risk mitigation.

Let me know what you guys think about this, and what is your recommendation here.

My core strategy of the large-cap index (50%) + mid-cap fund (30%) + small-cap fund (20%) as a moderate-risk long-term investor of 32 years of age remains the same - I just need to see how many funds to adjust this in.

Since the past 4 to 5 months, I've increased the amount of investment from 40k to 65k per month. I have some investment in small cap MF like Quant, Canara robeco and Parag pareikh flexicap and ICICI commodities. I also started studying and learning about stock market investments since the past 5 6 months and I've learnt a bit about swing trading. 

What I learnt from the course that I did was a lot of people do sip in stock baskets. Hence, I started with investing in smallcase baskets like top 100, 250, and metal tracker smallcases. 

Now I'm a bit confused and want to understand is if I should also start doing sips in a basket of stocks thro zerodha or smallcases (like larger baskets of windmill capital like dividend aristocrats, growth income etc) as I'm not very good at tracking and adding individual good stocks? 

I've some risk taking apepetite as I generally don't panic when market is down and I'm plan to stay invested for the long term like 5+ years. So I've a capital of 65k per month and want to do sips, and hence please help me understand how should I diversify my portfolio? And if I should do sips in basket of stocks thro smallcase/zerodha or stick to MF? Thanks a lot in advance.

Reddit,lg ipo,"LG Electronics IPO - What do think LG IPO is something to study for.

A company with leading position , having superior RoNW and Higher EPS then peers should generally command a premium valuation and not 38 - 42% discounted valuation. The fact that book runners are pricing it so conservatively despite QIB Demand is a question of Fact that they are trying to garuntee a sucess and not monetize it.

When you closely observe the IPO

1. The Outflow ratio is 117%, on top of it they have extracted ₹ 45,817Cr in last 2 years, which is more then the IPO ask i.e. ₹ 11,607 cr


2. Parent Company's Global performance is struggling, the topline CAGR is 3% with collapsing margins, while Indian entity is growing at 28% PAT CAGR. This shows that parent entity is higly depenedn on Indian asset, On top of it  Indian entity contributes to 50% of LG Holdings dividend recieved from Electronics verticle.


3. LG Holding lost the equity value by 76% , and Electronics value lost is by 36%. So it needs a desperate proof to show a new value creation to its Korean Investors, and best way to create value addition is to tap and use capital market bull runs in india. there fore i assuem they wanted a 100% sucess in this IPO just to balance LG Holding equity value creation for Korean investors.



This are my assumptions based on the filed DHRP reports, but i am sure many news and other outlets have more insider informations then me. Then why didnt anyone covered this aspects?

This IPO narrative is created as under valued listing which it definetely is, but if you look from LG holdings / LG Electronics INC (Parent company) its clearly a distress sale with value creation as their main motive.

What are your thoughts on this.

On the day of allotment it rose to about 34.65% (the allotment came at the EOD).
And, today (11th October 2025), it's at about 34.74% at 9.30 am.

India’s discount brokerage party seems to be slowing down and fast.

In the September 2025 quarter alone, over 26 lakh active clients vanished from discount brokerages. That’s almost half the total attrition for the entire year so far  roughly 50 lakh users gone in 9 months.

Even the big four  Groww, Zerodha, Angel One, and Upstox  felt the heat. Together, they made up 75% of the total decline.

Groww lost 6.7 lakh clients

Zerodha: 5 lakh

Angel One: 4.3 lakh

Upstox: 3 lakh.

The slowdown mirrors what’s happening in the markets  weaker corporate earnings, foreign outflows, and dull IPO listings(apart from LG) have dented retail enthusiasm. Sensex and Nifty both slipped around 4% this quarter, and the volatility seems to have scared off short-term traders.

Interestingly, a few smaller names Paytm Money, SBICap, and ICICI Securities actually gained clients, proving there’s still life left in the market… just shifting hands.

1. Indian Bank and HFCL among 9 F&O stocks saw a high increase in futures open interest. This indicates heightened trading activity and potential volatility. I’m considering selling straddles if the implied volatility remains elevated.

2. Manas Polymers and Energies IPO to list on Monday, with no GMP seen ahead of debut. This lack of grey market premium suggests a cautious market sentiment. I might stay on the sidelines for this one unless I see a strong opening.

3. Advance Agrolife IPO allotment status is out today. This might create some movement in the relevant sectors. I’ll be watching for any unusual volume spikes to decide if there’s an entry opportunity.

4. Two to Tango: Tata Capital and LG IPOs expected to siphon liquidity, starving secondary markets. This could mean reduced trading opportunities in the broader market. I’m thinking of focusing on IPOs this week as they might present better setups.

5. Bajaj Finance shares in focus after AUM grows 24% YoY in Q2 update. This promising growth can lead to bullish sentiment in the financial sector. I’m considering going long on Bajaj Finance if the momentum continues.

1. FIIs have significantly reduced their stakes in Adani Group firms, offloading shares worth over Rs 7,000 crore in the September quarter. I'm considering short positions in Adani stocks as this might indicate bearish sentiment.

2. KFin Technologies and seven other stocks are showing a bullish RSI upswing. I might explore long positions on these stocks, as high RSI levels often suggest upward momentum.

3. KEC International's share price is in focus due to an order win worth Rs 1,174 crore. This could be a bullish signal, and I'm thinking of going long on KEC International as order wins can drive stock prices up.

4. Mittal Sections IPO has seen muted subscription and GMP, suggesting a subdued listing premium. I may avoid this IPO for now, looking for more promising opportunities with better subscription rates.

Reddit,mittal sections ipo,"Sharing a (long term) success story Hello all, I am sharing a long term (by rough estimate of 34 years) success story. What you see in the picture is a our family's stock portfolio. I could have given a screenshot of broker but they are just so spread out. 



By our estimate, my father doesn't know for sure, the beginging of the pf goes back to 1990, and we have some securities since then. My father did good that he understood the potential of it, when others around him didn't. How he got started is that he used to work in bank, and folks used to come to banks to get demand draft in 90s when applying for IPO (how things have changed!!) and he along with other members of staff also used to apply to few, the only difference was that if got allotted, my fathers colleague used to sell to get listing gains, and he used to just hang on to them. And, with time he got himself more educated, we still get ""Dalal street investment Journal"" since late 90s. Though, he never invested in mutual funds, which i am still unable to understand. In my 12th grade, i supplied whole class of 25 students of commerce section with annual reports, and when i was a kid i always used to judge companies by quality of their annual reports, and colgate was the most finely printed. 



Was my father an ""educated"" investor, probably not, if you throw words like EPS, bull, bear, correction, pullback, EBIDTA, half of the word he would not understand, let alone answer them, but what he subconsciously knew was his strength which was limited activity, he has never really sold any shares because ""price was down"", if you ask me have beaten the market (TWRR or IRR), i can't answer that, but what i can answer is that we have created a sizable corpus of securities which all the people in our social group has not, and this is simple long term effect of compounding. 



Some points

-We would be what you call as active-passive investor, we have investment in every kind, Mutual funds, index funds, stocks public and private, india and outside. 



-Since time immorial we have applied to IPOs and we have some failures and some spectuacular successes. Some IPO successes are HDFC, Genus Power (no one knew of this until 2 years and we held thru all the ""dark"" days), Divis, Dmart. Recent ones are Kaynes, Zomato, and most recent in Bajaj Housing finance. And, we not sold a single one of them, they may die on us but haven't sold. 



-Some failures, one in particular comes to mind is golden forest based out of Chandigarh which later turned out to be a ponzi scheme, and then there is YesBank, some sucking IPOs are paytm and CapitalSFB. 



-We have held some stocks so long that we don't know what the purchase date is or purchase price, reliance (went thru whole emotional cycle of Dhiru dying, brothers quarrel, ADAG and Jio, and now expected division into 3 companies), Colgate, LT, Videocon, which we was high flyer and then went private (Nayara) but we have held thru it. 



-For good or bad, we have always considered this PF as something which is like family ""darohar"" something which has to be passed onto generations, and we treat it like that, something to be not messed up. 



I am not saying this is best method or the only method, I am saying this is a method which we, in my opinion have achieved success. As they say play your own game. 



I'll end with a comment my father makes when we talk about frequent downturns in stocks ""'my name"" abhi to 1st inning hai, game ka result to 5th day ko pata chalega"". We have never graduated from 1st inning. 



If you have any questions feel free.

My recent experiences have not been great, with several issues arising related to funds, intraday transaction etc. The latest was with an IPO application, where I faced slow responses, a delay in unblocking funds for two days, and incorrect IPO status updates.

While I may be mistaken, it seems that Zerodha is investing more on educating investor over enhancing user experience. Although I do not oppose this strategy, it should not distract Zerodha from the R&D of their primary revenue-generating services i.e Kite.

Reddit,mittal sections ipo,"Additional Resources for Fundamental Analysis! **Precursor:** *In this post, I’ll mention some lesser-known resources that I find really useful and that can help you further in your fundamental research. Let’s jump straight into it.*

**1. Tijori Finance:**

I primarily use **Screener**, but **Tijori Finance** provides data that isn’t as easily accessible on Screener.in.

**For example:**

https://preview.redd.it/nmfloulooynd1.jpg?width=1765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77aca7b827d9d8ed80e23d889a5d68b38d501be9

Take **Polycab**—Tijori Finance shows the **product mix**, **export percentages** to different regions, and sometimes even the **distribution channels**. The product mix is especially helpful if you want to quickly discover what contributes the most revenue for the company and then dive deeper from there.

https://preview.redd.it/zdrevr2roynd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=d552db45f81b6fa5ea0a83e89ffb73e4a294de61

In some cases, Tijori even shows the market share of a company. While I’d recommend double-checking the data with other sources, it helps give you a rough idea of where the company stands.

[Screener.in](http://Screener.in) only shows segmental revenue to paid users. For product mix, you can check the company’s latest presentation or annual report, but Tijori Finance offers a quicker option.

https://preview.redd.it/2dplwt1xoynd1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4cc76868d3de62254f141c58894e4760a01f32

Another feature I appreciate in Tijori is the list of links to various articles and videos relevant to the company, right at the bottom of the page.

**2. DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus):**

If you’re not familiar, a **DRHP** is an offer document issued by a company and submitted to SEBI before it goes public. Even though I don’t invest in IPOs, I enjoy reading DRHPs of companies going public because they offer valuable insights into specific industries..

For instance, in the DRHP of **Hyundai**, if you navigate to the ***Industry Overview*** section from the table of contents,

https://preview.redd.it/eb1x6yiyoynd1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce7821e8375278864ebce06b60ae208804fc390

You can get great insights of the **automobile industry**, including market shares and growth trends, to understand the industry's dynamics. You can find the latest [DRHPs here.](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=3&ssid=15&smid=11)

Another helpful resource for sector research is **Motilal Oswal’s sectoral research reports**

https://preview.redd.it/z548l2ozoynd1.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ddb9ea4605652fd3ef3ffbe263620a3690b8ff

Motilal Oswal's website, Research 360, provides up-to-date [sector reports](https://www.research360.in/research-report/sector-report) on industries like financials, hotels, and insurance, offering the latest updates.

[Ibef.org](http://Ibef.org) is another website by ministry of commerce which offers great sectoral insights.

**3. Credit Ratings:**

**Credit ratings** are an underrated resource that can significantly enhance your fundamental research. These reports often contain information that’s hard to find elsewhere.

For example, when I was researching **Eimco Elecon**, a capital goods company that makes underground mining equipment, the credit report gave me a critical insight.

[Eimco Elecon Credit Report](https://preview.redd.it/c8jva6qgpynd1.jpg?width=1038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f9bc6e95df8c93426be2a8496edbc049ed1bd53)

It revealed that the company enjoys a **near-monopoly** in the underground mining equipment segment, with **Coal India as its biggest customer**. That was something I hadn’t come across in other sources and was a key piece of information.

[Lotus Chocolate Company Credit Report](https://preview.redd.it/hdi2samjpynd1.jpg?width=967&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba943cee3c75e494484e52abfffa3d37f19a7ac)

At first glance, the **outrageous valuation** and frequent **upper circuits** were clear red flags. Nonetheless, I wanted to know what the company does. The credit report for **Lotus Chocolate** showed that it had notable **B2B clients** like **Amul** and **Mother Dairy**.

Overall, credit reports are a great resource for gaining deeper insights, especially for lesser-known companies

**4. ValuePickr:**

Many seasoned investors may already know about this one, but for those who don’t, **ValuePickr** is a forum of passionate investors who discuss various companies in dedicated threads.

[ValuePickr Forum](https://preview.redd.it/lx2gmj3spynd1.png?width=1527&format=png&auto=webp&s=569c65884661074c413d94b4133e6cd85e8f8371)

The site has an incredible wealth of information on different companies. Some of the threads go back 5 or even 10 years, and you can find **old annual reports, presentations, and discussions dating back** many years.

[Polycab's thread](https://preview.redd.it/8u93e66upynd1.jpg?width=1392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b47c157fc83b3b10c5048dfbe4ace0470c5ad35)

It’s an excellent tool if you want to track **the management’s execution** or learn more about a company. You might even discover companies that aren’t in the limelight yet.

I follow threads of the companies I'm invested in and **regularly** check for updates. It's one of my favorite resources for research, with knowledgeable investors sharing news and insights..

**To Conclude:** I can’t emphasize enough how crucial it is to review a company’s annual report, presentations, and transcripts as primary sources for fundamental research. That said, I wanted to highlight some additional resources that can offer further insights..

Hope this helps with your fundamental analysis! If you have any other tools to recommend, please share them in the comments below.

Then, while testing he pressed 4 times on apply button for swiggy ipo, and it added 4 times, which was an honest mistake at his end.

Now , the folks at brandywine are forcing him to pay for all 4 slots, even though there is no proof that he got any stocks allocated apart from that shady app, and are sending him legal notice that looks fake.

I'm posting this query here to know if someone has idea about this firm or not. And if there is any way to get our money back.

  
edit 1: adding the notice that they have sent , ( it's sent as a image from their side, even though it's a document )

There’s a bit of a weird understanding around company ownership in India. If you’re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company’s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company’s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a “promoter”, you end up effectively owning \[1\] the company.

There’s quite a bit of confusion and conflict around this understanding. Sometimes the founder and CEO of a company owning 10% doesn’t want to be called the promoter, but is [forced to](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vijay-shekhar-sharma-paytm-directors-face-sebi-show-cause-notices-over-ipo-breaches-12806852.html). Other times an investor who owns 17% [cannot remove](https://www.medianama.com/2021/10/223-explained-zee-invesco-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a promoter holding less than 4%.

Being a promoter is a state of being. You don’t need a large stake. If you’re calling the shots day-to-day, you’re a promoter. It works the other way too. If you don’t control a company just yet, but want to, you better get yourself put down as a promoter. It’s like drawing a superpower from within the soul of the company that gives you the permission and access to decide how it works.

This week, the Burman family, who are the promoters of the Ayurvedic brand Dabur, also [became the promoters](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/burman-family-acquires-control-become-promoters-of-religare-enterprises-125022001226_1.html) of Religare Enterprises, a financial services conglomerate. They were in the market to own about 51% of Religare, but their offer to buy the public’s shares failed miserably. No matter! They still own 25% of its shares, but more importantly, after a long-drawn conflict, they passed the company’s vibe check and managed to call themselves its promoters.

# An offer that you can refuse

Before this week, Religare did not have a promoter. They did, [once upon a time](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/from-singh-brothers-to-burman-brothers-religares-promoter-blues-continue/articleshow/105266662.cms?from=mdr), but for the last seven years they didn’t. This isn’t a problem. There are large companies like ITC and HDFC Bank without a promoter, and all it means is that there is no one shareholder calling the shots on how the company operates. The shareholders with varying levels of ownership have some representation on the board, which then assigns the CEO, and the CEO reports to the board just as a regular employee would. (And when the CEO leaves, their son or nephew doesn’t take over.)

In September 2023, the Burmans owned \~21% of Religare, which they bought over a few years from the open market. They intended to buy 4% more and exceed 25% in total ownership. There’s a SEBI mandate around such high ownership. If you happen to own 25% of a company’s shares, you have to then offer to buy at least 26% of its remaining shares as well. The idea is that this gives *you* the opportunity to own a controlling stake in the company, and also gives people who may not like you the opportunity to sell their stock to you and get out.

If you’re a serious buyer, your offer to the public had better be more than the stock’s market price. We’re talking about a publicly listed company here—people can sell their shares and move on anyway. The only reason they’d sell to you is if you offered them a better-than-market price for their shares.

When the Burman family first announced their intention to run an offer, Religare’s stock price was around ₹270. The Burmans offered ₹235, a good 13% lower.

The Burmans announced the offer one-and-a-half years back, but it actually happened just last week. And [it failed](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/EFAC8052-C655-4C3B-BC69-8B8C5D55B04A-134530.pdf)! They were out to buy ₹2,116 crore of Religare stock. Shareholders agreed to sell only 0.25% of that, about ₹5.4 crore.

That’s what makes the Burman family’s successful takeover a little weird. They made a shitty offer, it didn’t go through, and yet they control Religare? Tell me if being a promoter isn’t a state of being.

# She does not give up

There are two things I want to mention about Rashmi Saluja, one of them totally irrelevant to this story.

1. Until last week, she was the executive chairperson of Religare.
2. She was [deboarded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-kicks-out-troublesome-head-of-a-top-financial-company-as-she-was-rude/articleshow/108285668.cms?from=mdr) from an Air India flight for being rude to the crew.

Saluja had been the chairperson since [December 2019](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/a7a2e5c3-6e03-4b41-998b-bd6ad741896a.pdf) (the deboarding happened last year) at a time when Religare was almost a dead company because its founders [stole](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-court-frames-criminal-conspiracy-charges-former-religare-enterprises-promoters-loss-firm-9784145/) from the company. I don’t know how Religare turned around, but it did. Saluja had been the chairperson all this while so looks like she did a [good job](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rashmi-saluja-steered-religare-2-0-through-upheaval-changed-firms-fortunes/articleshow/93994326.cms?from=mdr) with it.

https://preview.redd.it/591lou39q1le1.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb9f0ee3177b565cebbbf0de1e53079db0c3c86

Saluja did not want the Burmans to take over Religare. Makes sense to me. If you’re a corporate turnaround artist at a financial services company, you wouldn’t want the company to be taken over by a billionaire family selling [adulterated honey](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/honey-fraud-our-response-to-statements-from-dabur-patanjali-74512). But just how far do you go to keep your job?

Pretty far. Here’s a bit from [earlier this month](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rashmi-saluja-moves-court-again-religare-board-fights-back-3746738/) from the Financial Express:

>The battle for control of Religare Enterprises (REL) has started looking like a never-ending soap opera. On Tuesday, Rashmi Saluja, the ousted executive chairperson of REL, made the first move by filing a fresh writ petition in the Delhi High Court, seeking to quash the open offer by the Burman family-led entities. This marks the seventh legal attempt by her to stall the takeover process. The court is expected to hear her petition on Wednesday (today).

Seventh legal attempt! Saluja does not give up. \[2\]

# Fit and proper!

Religare is a holding company for a brokerage, an insurance company, and an NBFC, among other smaller businesses. For the Burman family to become the promoter, they had to get the approval of the regulator for each line of business. That’s SEBI for being a broker, IRDAI for insurance, and RBI for the NBFC.

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, but someone looking to buy a company like Religare, cannot apply directly to the regulators for approval. Instead, the company itself has to go to its regulators and say “hey this guy’s looking to buy me, are you okay if we let him run an offer for our shareholders to consider?”. The company does have some discretion here. If a potential acquirer isn’t credible, it need not go to the regulators and waste their time. But the Burmans already owned 21% of Religare, obviously had the means to buy more, so Religare didn’t really have any room for discretion.

And yet, Religare’s board, led by Saluja, decided that it did not want to take the Burmans’ offer to the regulators for approval. Apparently the Burmans did not meet the criteria that owners and executives for financial companies must be “fit and proper”.

Fit and proper? That sounds familiar. [We spoke about](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=SEBI%20wanted%20the%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%20which%20is%20just%20a%20bunch%20of%20floor%20criteria%20for%20stuff%20like%20not%20having%20defrauded%20anyone%20or%20being%20a%20criminal.%20Embassy%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20argument%20was%20that%20its%20CEO%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%3F!) these criteria last year when a company argued that their CEO need not be fit and proper. Here Religare is arguing that the potential buyer absolutely must be fit and proper, and that it was deciding that they were not. Surely the Burmans must be in some financial soup? No?

From[ From a Mint report](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bid-to-block-religare-acquisition-burman-family-slams-false-fir-linking-dabur-group-to-mahadev-betting-app-case-11699955913805.html):

>Members of the Dabur group have issued a rebuttal after reports linked its chairman and director to the Mahadev betting app case. The Mumbai Police has reportedly booked 32 people – including Mohit Burman and Gaurav Burman – under various sections of fraud and gambling. A spokesperson for the Burman family however dubbed it a ‘baseless’ accusation that happened to coincide with their bid to acquire Religare Enterprises.

>“We have not received any formal communication on any such FIR. However, we have sighted the FIR which is being circulated to media houses. The FIR is patently false and baseless. Nothing could be further from the truth than as wrongly stated in the FIR,” the spokesperson said.

The Burmans announced that it was going to do an open offer and in a few weeks there were reports that they had an FIR registered against them in an unrelated betting scam. \[3\] Religare used these reports to decide that the Burmans weren’t fit and proper, and wouldn’t even apply for approval to the regulators for good measure.

The Burmans then went to SEBI about this, who eventually forced Religare to actually apply for approval. [This was in June 2024](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2024/interim-order-cum-show-cause-notice-in-the-matter-of-religare-enterprises-limited_84286.html), a good nine months after the Burman family’s initial offer announcement. \[4\]

# Stall, stall, stall

Every year, usually sometime between July and September, every listed company in India holds their annual general meeting. This meeting is when companies are able to get all their important shareholders in one room and have them vote on things that need their approval to go through. Shareholders can also ask the board and executives questions (or share their unsolicited opinions) about the company.

Religare’s annual meeting was scheduled for sometime in September 2024, but the board delayed it to December. From [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/religare-enterprises-agm-delay-shareholders-rashmi-saluja-investors-burman-family-dabur-11724591594022.html):

>Three institutional shareholders said they were unhappy with the decision to postpone the AGM, especially since the company has given no explanation. The delay becomes crucial as chairperson Rashmi Saluja was up for reappointment at this AGM, initially scheduled for September.

>\[…\]

>Saluja is the only non-independent director on the Religare board and, therefore, comes up for retirement at each AGM. The vote to reappoint her will now take place in December after the company secured approval to defer the AGM by three months.

Saluja needed to win the shareholder vote to be reappointed as the chairperson of Religare. This vote is usually a formality, shareholders like to go for whoever’s being presented. Saluja probably didn’t want to risk it, so the meeting was pushed.

Then in December, some random guy filed a public interest litigation (?) in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur—a city that Religare has absolutely nothing to do with—and the court [asked to](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/madhya-pradesh-hc-stays-religare-enterprises-agm-in-response-to-pil/119722) wait on the meeting scheduled for 31 December (which by itself is a weird day to hold a meeting). In January, the court [finally allowed](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/madhya-pradesh-high-court-dismisses-pil-religare-agm-rashmi-saluja-125010900673_1.html) the meeting to proceed because it figured that the litigation was BS.

The meeting was then scheduled again for February, and this was challenged in court again! This time by Saluja herself in the Delhi High Court. The court [refused](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/delhi-hc-rejects-rashmi-saluja-s-plea-to-halt-religare-enterprises-agm-125020601716_1.html) to halt the meeting.

On 7 February, the meeting finally took place and [here’s what happened](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-suspense-at-agm-over-reappointment-of-saluja-3741671/):

>The annual general meeting (AGM) of Religare Enterprises on Friday took an interesting turn after chairperson Rashmi Saluja stopped the discussion on her reappointment (agenda 2), stating that she was not liable to retire by rotation, said sources.

>“So, we can ignore resolution number 2,” she said. When an independent director present at the meeting contested her decision, she dismissed the intervention, saying that his remarks should be taken on record.

Saluja still doesn’t give up! In the meeting, she told everyone that she wasn’t due to retire, and so there was no need for everyone to vote on her reappointment. How thoughtful of her to save everyone’s time.

Of course, that wasn’t the end of it. In the physical meeting, she managed to stop people from voting against her by making sure the vote itself didn’t happen. But voting was held online for shareholders who weren’t at the meeting and two days later [97%](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-over-97-religare-shareholders-reject-salujas-reappointment-3744393/) of Religare’s shareholders had voted against her reappointment. She was *finally* removed from her position as executive chairperson.

# It’s a state of being

Back to the Burmans. They wanted to become the promoters of Religare and decide how it should operate. Initially, Religare’s board of directors were against this and resisted to the extent that they could. Later it was just Saluja who remained obstinate to the extent of not even letting the Burmans’ offer reach the shareholders.

Becoming the promoter isn’t just about owning a large stake. Sure, yes, more shares don’t hurt. And beyond 51% there’s not a lot anyone else can do. But with Saluja no longer a board member, there was no one to stop the Burman family from becoming a promoter. So they became the promoter! Like I said, being a promoter is a state of being.

If Saluja hadn’t been booted out, whoever knows what would’ve happened? With the Burmans’ offer practically rejected by shareholders, there is no way she would’ve let Religare name them as the promoters. Eventually, sure, the Burmans would have succeeded. But that would cost time, legal fees, and maybe a lot more money for yet another long-drawn offer.

# Stay out of jail card

Why was Saluja hell bent on halting the Burmans’ offer? Maybe because she paid herself a lot! She held too much sway within the company and figured out a way to earn many multiples more than other executives at the same level. From [the Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/religare-finvest-issued-esops-to-rashmi-saluja-a-day-after-burmans-open-offer/articleshow/106497688.cms?from=mdr):

>\[…\] Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award, documents reviewed by ET reveal.

>The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore. Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.

Highest paid executive in *Indian corporate history*! \[5\] Most of Saluja’s compensation came from the employee stock options pool of Religare’s subsidiaries, worth anywhere between ₹630 crore to ₹740 crore ($73m to $86m). Her stake was so high that it would represent 8% of Religare’s NBFC! The stock option pool is usually between 5–10%, meant to serve as an incentive for *all* employees to work to get the stock price up and stick around for longer. Saluja hogged the entire thing.

Okay, fighting to stay around as the highest paid executive in Indian corporate history would be alluring. But come on, the annual general meeting was seven days away, and she sued the company she was the chairperson at! And asked shareholders to casually ignore something they were to vote on! That’s extreme.

The Burman family have been [demanding](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/burman-family-demands-sebi-investigation-in-allotment-of-8-esops-shares-to-rfl-chairman-rashmi-saluja-11704286617650.html) an investigation into Saluja’s compensation. If the numbers are true, and they seem to be, Saluja has almost certainly been defrauding the company and its investors. With the Burmans running the company, I wouldn’t be surprised if any documentation around her compensation reached the investigator as a neatly formatted PDF of evidence. That makes her extreme behaviour make a [little bit more](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ed-summons-religare-chairperson-rashmi-saluja-for-questioning/articleshow/116183872.cms?from=mdr) sense.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I use “ownership” for promoters liberally, even though they don’t technically own the company. In everyday conversation I think the distinction doesn’t matter.

\[2\] This better be the name of any biography that happens to be written about Saluja.

\[3\] There’s some [dumb stuff happening](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/remote-controlled-plaint-cops-may-quiz-rashmi-saluja/articleshow/118461248.cms) here that I wouldn’t even be able to scratch the surface of.

\[5\] I like how the Economic Times emphasises this, but this may or may not be true! I doubt Saluja would keep getting those stock options every year for life.

In FY23 online penetration of the air segment stood at 70% of all air travel, expected to increase to 80% by FY28. Share of online hotel booking is low at 32%.

**The Bus segment is highly underpenetrated by OTAs and represents an increasing segment in terms of volume.** Long haul intercity bus services have good revenue margins for players like RedBus, AbhiBus (ixigo bus business), PayTM and RailYatri. For middle market OTAs, this represents the next frontier of growth from Tier- II & III cities and provides the bulk of their top line and growth. **Bus along with the air is the fastest growing online travel segment, with a forecasted CAGR for Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2028 of 18%**  
  


**Breakup of the travel industry ( by revenues)**

Airline ticketing 44%

Hotel booking 26%

Rail ticketing 16%  
Bus ticketing 14%  
  


**Growth drivers**

With per capita income growth, discretionary spends on travel to increase, leading to growth in OTA industry, along with further increase in share of online booking will drive the growth.  
Convenience of booking with OTAs, making luxury destinations affordable to fit into middle-income consumer budget , workation ( working during travelling)- all these are fostering growth of travel industry.

The surge in affordable smartphone users is expected to reach 1 billion users by 2026, according to TRAI. This, coupled with high speed internet connectivity( launch of 4G/ 5G) will drive online bookings.

The ability of OTAs to offer value added services that offer additional protection and refund guarantees such as zero cancellation fee programmes, fully refundable and flexible ticket types, price protection, travel insurance etc. and their ability to bundle in multiple types of services in one transaction.

A shift in demographics of overall travellers to the age group of 18–35 years who are dominating the Indian travel scene, comprising almost 66% of the overall trips.  


Market leader is MakeMyTrip with 24% market share, and other players are Ixigo, Easemytrip, Cleartrip. Ixigo’s market share of the overall OTA market (flights, trains, hotels and buses) by GTV stood at 6% in FY23.

Reddit,mittal sections ipo,"How will rate cuts affect the stock market Hey everyone, Prajwal here! How’s everyone doing?

I wanted to discuss how the upcoming interest rate cuts from the Fed might affect the stock market. Generally, lower rates are considered good for the stock market because they make borrowing cheaper for companies and consumers. Additionally, compared to bonds and fixed deposits, the returns from stocks start looking more attractive. This leads to improved market sentiment and potentially rising stock prices.

On the other hand, many believe that the decision to cut rates is influenced by bad economic circumstances or a looming catastrophe, which forces the Fed to cut rates, signaling an impending economic disaster.

That’s the thing about the markets, right? For every piece of news, there’s a bull case and a bear case. For every price, there’s a buyer and a seller. Which boat are you in? What do you all think?

Historically, the aftereffects of Fed rate cuts have been mixed. Whether in the 2000s, 2008, or 2019, the rate cuts did not have much impact initially but stabilized and positively impacted the markets after a year or so. As the effects of rate cuts are generally lagging, this is expected, but every time is different, as they say.

As for India, our domestic inflows are currently very strong. Look at the responses all the IPOs are getting—people are just going crazy over the markets, and the impact of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) is getting lower and lower. However, they still hold a significant chunk, and any global catastrophe will ripple through to us as well. But as long as retailers are pumping in money, this bull market is not going away.

As for me, I think if the rate cuts happen slowly and gradually, like 25 bps every quarter, and stabilize at around 3%, this will keep the bull market roaring. However, if the Fed cuts aggressively, like 50 bps here and there, it could indicate that things in the economy are not good and a crash could be coming soon.

**Disclaimer**: These are just my opinions and thoughts. Do not take what I’m saying as true or false without doing your own research. I'm also adding my verified PnL here because of few trollers who keep asking for it. [https://console.zerodha.com/verified/38371e72](https://console.zerodha.com/verified/38371e72)

Reddit,mittal sections ipo,"How do you research a startup IPO if there is hardly any historical data? &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jjjwby8asdm91.jpg?width=5799&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f3db23f7631c3e8d08830379f6308c68c88c9be

In general, a company, at a particular stage of the growth curve, applies for IPO. The primary target of these companies is to infuse cash into the system through IPO necessary for expansion. There are more reasons also. 

But for a startup, things are different. Earlier, SEBI only allowed such companies to float IPOs that have a total business value of 1000 crores or 1 billion rupees. This eligibility criterion was a little flexible for companies that have good growth prospects. And there were other prerequisites also. But when the startup companies grew SEBI found that they have very good growth prospects because of the products or services they offer. 

So, now we can find new startup companies coming up with IPOs. These companies are freshly founded and are not like the orthodox types of companies. These companies have new kinds of products or services that are well suited to changing business horizons. These companies do not follow the orthodox business routes. But they have tremendous business growth potential. SEBI also felt that these companies need to have access to huge capital to support their growth. Therefore, SEBI allowed them to exploit the IPO route that will allow these companies to infuse capital into their business plan. Also being a public limited company, the ownership will be divided among the shareholders who will purchase equity shares from the exchanges. 

This opportunity given by SEBI allowed these companies to grow fast. More and more startups are coming into the market and bringing IPOs. But for an investor buying IPOs, it is becoming hard for an investor to know about the companies from the historical data. Very little historical data is available for these companies because most of them are newly born companies.

So, what can an investor do when the investor wants to study the company before investing? Due to a lack of past data, it will be very hard to judge the company and form an idea of how they are going to perform in future. The investor should be worried about his/ her investment. He/ she will want to know whether his / her money is in good hands or not.

These are unique cases even for a hardened investor. Every investor wants to gather information about the company in which the investor is about to invest. But if there is not ample information available what can the investor do? Either he is not going to invest or he will try to delve into whatever resources are available to him. For the startup IPOs, the investor primarily has a voluminous document available known as the DRHF or the Draft Red Herring Prospectus. 

An investor must read the DRHP thoroughly. In order to gather information, the investor got to do the painstaking work of studying the voluminous document diligently and gathering all the required information. This is the only printed material that the investor has that the company submitted before SEBI to avail approval for IPO. SEBI makes it clear that all information given in the document is correct. SEBI has a team of experts who investigate the company and check all the credentials given in the DRHP. Therefore, it takes a long time to get approval after a company approaches SEBI for IPO. Once the document is cleared and the company is given a green signal to come out with the IPO, an investor can rely on the facts stated in DRHP to be true. 

Hence, the investor can rely on the facts given in the prospectus and find the weak points of the company. Else, there may be some conditions which the investor may think to be unjust and not invest in the company. To make the DRHP more digestible, we have given some guidelines on which the investor can judge the merits of the company. Let’s discuss the main aspects of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

· The DRHP at the first glance looks a little bit confusing. Keep aside your experience and look for the core business for which the startup is floating IPO. 

There is a completely separate section in which the company explains the detailed business model of the company, the product and everything about the company itself. The investor will get to know about the company. It is necessary for an investor to know the company, its location, its manufacturing unit and the business model.

Next, the business model is explained in the prospectus. You need to understand the business model and the product or services the company offers. If the investor knows and understands the product/ services and under how the market is going to accept that, a clear idea can be formed on how the revenue is going to come and help the company to make a profit. The company projects the path of future revenue and company growth. With the help of charts and data, everything is clearly explained. But the investor needs to understand it. 

An investor must understand the company and its business model to get a clear picture of the risk where the investor’s money is going to be invested. This is especially true for all startup IPOs. With minimum historical data on hand, the investor needs to be clear about the business model which will fetch revenue for the company.

· Just like the business details there is another section explaining the risk factors. In this section, the company explains all the details of financial and other risks the investor may be subjected to. The company also explains there how the risk factors can affect the business and future profitability of the company.

The investor must check out the major risk factors inherent to the company product or business model. Supposing, there is a raw material risk which is not readily available. Hence, the unavailability of raw materials will disrupt business and directly affect profitability. Understanding these major risk factors is important for an investor to realize how risky the investment is.

· Next comes another very important part, the financial statement. The investor can find all the details of moveable and unmoveable assets, liabilities, expenses, earnings till date, profit and profit after tax and the complete balance sheet. Some important company like CRR, P/E can be found. Also the present financial health indicators like cash reserve, cash inflow, cash in hand and present debt – all can be found in the financial statements. If it is found that cash reserve is not good, the company has high amount of debt etc. it is better to not to invest in that IPO because most of the proceeds will be spent to pay debt.

· As I mentioned earlier the prospectus show in details where and how the company is planning to spend the proceeds. If a company uses the main share of IPO money to pay the debt, that is not a good proposal. Paying the previous debt may make the company debt free, but this is a misutilisation of funds. Unless the company proposes to use the fund for the growth of the company and increase earning potential, why should an investor invest in a company to pay their past debt? An investor should keep away from it. 

· The company management and their past track record is an important determining factor. A good management team can make a company lead the race if the company basics are solid. Once you have gone through the financial statements and the use of proceeds and satisfied with what was written on the prospectus, your job is only half done. The prospectus say all about the management team and their experience in running such business, the founder investors and the promoters. 

If the management team has proven track record of running similar business successfully, you can be assured that your investment will be in good hands. A good business model, a worthy product/ services run under an efficient management team is good enough to make a business successful profit earning. Hence it is an omportant aspect to look for.

· After you are satisfied with the management team, next comes the founder investors and promoters. It is important to make an idea the true intention of the company to come up with the IPO. Past records found in digital archive may be useful. If the promoters have a notion to dump their shares in the open market after listing and after the lock-up period is over, the investor should not invest in that company. Past track records of any of the promoter can give a clue to that. If you even have least doubt about their intentions, you will think twice before investment. 

· The DRHP give details of the IPO. One should look into these details to find whether the promoter is going to sell its majority of shares through this IPO. This in itself is alarming. In addition, in IPO details you will find probable share price, number of shares, projected earnings per share and all other details related to IPO of the company. By finding the company ratios they can be compared with the peer company aleady in the stock market to get an idea about how the company is going to perform in future.

Given above is a rough guideline on how a company performance can be researched from the prospectus and a little help from internet. You can make a workable structure to investigate about the company and how it may perform after the IPO process is complete. An investor can make decisions on the basis of these findings on whether to invest in the IPO or not.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Before you jump into Tata Capital IPO. Please read this. The Tata Capital IPO is set to launch on October 6, 2025, and will close on October 8, 2025. The listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) is scheduled for October 13, 2025. This ₹15,511.87 crore issue includes a fresh issue of ₹6,846 crore and an offer for sale of ₹8,665.87 crore. The price band has been set between ₹310 and ₹326 per share, with a minimum lot size of 46 shares, translating to an investment of approximately ₹14,996 for retail investors. 


ANALYSIS
The Tata brand is strong, but here’s a closer look at the numbers:

•Profits: FY23 showed a high profit (~₹7,000cr), largely from a one-time gain. Core earnings come from interest on loans and fees, which are sensitive to RBI rate changes.

•Debt profile: Borrowings are significant. The housing finance subsidiary (TCHFL) has around 7% non-performing loans, compared with 1.9% overall.

•Cash flow: Free cash flow from core operations is modest. Provisions for bad loans fluctuate year-on-year, reflecting the nature of lending business.

•Key ratios: Capital adequacy is 16.9% (vs peers like Bajaj Finance at 21.9%). Provision coverage ratio has decreased from 74% → 58%. Return on equity was boosted by the one-time gain.

•Valuation: This is the company’s first IPO, so no prior stock performance. Employee stock options are high, which could dilute future shareholder value. Some assets use Level 3 valuation models, which are less transparent.

•Legal & tax matters: Tata Capital and its 
subsidiaries are involved in ~12,000 ongoing cases, including tax disputes worth ~₹5,600cr, consumer complaints, and borrower-related matters.

•Governance: The board largely consists of Tata insiders. There are risk committees, though subsidiaries continue to carry higher exposures.

Final take- Tata Capital combines a trusted brand and scale with certain financial and operational risks. Understanding the debt structure, subsidiary performance, and ongoing legal matters can help potential investors make an informed decision.

The scale of this settlement reveals the enormous profits generated through privileged order flow access, early order detection and front-running capabilities granted to a handful of players. Many Nifty 50 companies' liquidity appears sustained by capital accumulated through these questionable practices over the past decade, while retail investors bore the costs through [brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) that facilitated this unequal system.

With only token actions taken against CNBC/ET Now tipster Gift City based IIFL Securities' director Sanjiv Bhasin or index banks like IndusInd Bank, ICICI , RHFL etc ( a long list ) this precedent risks further entrenching the advantage of sophisticated algorithmic traders (like Jane Street's GPU-based systems), potentially eliminating any remaining non-algo participants.

Instead of permitting alleged manipulation profits to remain concentrated among privileged market players, shouldn't regulatory mechanisms be established to compensate defrauded traders? This could take the form of direct restitution or tax relief measures - rather than continuing a system that has disproportionately benefited select entities for decades.

The current settlement attempts to whitewash what may represent one of India's most significant financial scandals - one that has enriched both corporate and political interests through systematic market advantages. Now, these same patterns risk being perpetuated through new AI-driven trading systems that provide even greater opacity and deniability.

This raises fundamental questions about our judicial system's ability to address such complex financial crimes in a timely manner - whether examining the 7-year deliberation on electoral bonds, Justice Varma's proceedings, or the stalled Boeing investigations. The systemic delays and loopholes suggest institutional frameworks remain ill-equipped to confront modern financial engineering, leaving retail investors perpetually vulnerable.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Hyundai IPO: The other side Hello Everyone. I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter here about why you shouldn’t jump on the Hyundai India IPO, and while some points are valid, I want to share another side of the story. Not saying you should or shouldn't invest—**just clearing up some misconceptions and dropping some data to show you the other-side.**

**This IPO is not without problems I'm sure you must have seen problems on this sub already. THIS POST WILL LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.**

# Hyundai India's PE Ratio Vs Hyundai Korea's PE Ratio

One common gripe is Hyundai India’s PE ratio is around 25 versus Hyundai Korea’s \~5. Yeah, that's true, but it misses the bigger picture. Check out these other companies:

|Indian Company|Indian Company's PE|Foreign Company|Foreign Company's PE|Ratio between PEs|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|73|Nestle SA|19|3.84|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|63|Unilever PLC|22|2.86|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|29|Suzuki Motor Corp|9.5|2.7|
|BASF India|54.5|BASF SE|12.5|4.36|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|70|GSK plc|15|4.66|

Notice a trend? Indian subsidiaries usually trade at a premium. It’s because India’s seen as a high-growth market, and the free float (how many shares are available for trading) is typically lower, pushing up the PE.

We can do the same comparing Revenue to Market cap also.

|Indian Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|Foreign Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|2.32|28.27|Nestle SA|111.03|250.50|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|7.35|77.84|Unilever plc|58.20|157.06|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|16.56|46.38|Suzuki Motor Corp|36.60|19.87|
|BASF India|1.72|4.28|BASF SE|70.43|44.73|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|0.4|5.4|GSK plc|39.46|79.54|
|Hyundai India|8.3|19|Hyundai Motor Co|125.35|44.86|

This data honestly surprised me too. Suzuki Motor Corp holds 58% of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. This suggests that the rest of Suzuki Motor Corp is actually negatively valued. And yes the Revenue being more than the market cap for some companies is not a mistake. This just goes to show the discrepancy between the foreign and Indian share markets.

My point here is that the Indian company will **ALWAYS** seem overvalued compared to their foreign parents. Even if you were to dig deeper like I did with the Suzuki Example, you will realise that the market cap for the foreign company seems to be disproportionately coming from the Indian company which would be listed as an Asset on their books.

# Comparing PE/Valuation with Competition

|Company|Market Cap (Cr INR)|Revenue (Cr INR)|PE Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Maruti Suzuki|3,91,000|1,46,000|29.01|
|Mahindra and Mahindra|3,78,000|1,42,000|33.56|
|Tata Motors|3,37,000|4,44,000|10.75|
|Hyundai India|1,59,258|71,302|**\~26.5**|

So, the PE ratios for Hyundai India is actually less than Maruti and Mahindra. It's market cap to revenue ratio is also lower than Maruti and Mahindra. Tata motors is the exception here since they do operate in more sectors.

Now I know that you should not judge stocks solely based on PEs, but this provides a quick overview as to where Hyundai India stands. You and dig deep through their books and you will find that everything seems to be inline with their peers.

Even their Market Cap to Revenue is inline with Maruti and Mahindra.

# Index Inclusion: Why It Matters

Hyundai India is set to be included in major stock indexes (Nifty 100, Nifty 500, Possibly Nifty Next 50) within the next 6 months. Once it’s in the indexes, lots of passive funds will automatically buy it, increasing demand and potentially driving up the price.

At IPO, Hyundai India’s market cap will be similar to big players like Punjab National Bank or Adani Energy Solutions. Even 2-3% of shares going to index funds can mean around 10% of total free float shares getting snapped up. The actively managed funds will also want to buy Hyundai India since it’s now part of their benchmark Index, boosting demand even more.

# The Offer for Sale (OFS)

I have to say that the OFS offering has lead to some South Korean hate on this sub. This is insane and should not be happening. Hyundai came into India, set up a subsidiary, manufacturing and genuine created value. And even if their actions are ""Greedy"", that is just one company. It's insane to see this hate being directed at South Korea as a whole.

So what's exactly happening: Hyundai Korea is selling shares, not Hyundai India. They **claim** to need funds for R&D which happens at the Parent company while Hyundai India is only for Manufacturing. This IPO lets them get cash without Hyundai having to take on debt or dilute its equity.

**Hyundai Korea still holds a majority after the IPO, so they’re not just exiting.** They’re still invested and running the show, ensuring that the company has the backing it needs for future growth. They very much still have skin in the game. OFS is actually not that uncommon when you look at it. The Indian company's financials are healthy and it simply doesn't need a cash injection at this point.

# The Dividend

Pre-IPO dividends can sound sketchy, but they’re actually pretty common. Look at Indigo—they did the same thing. Hyundai India is using its generated cash to pay dividends, which should be factored into your valuation calculations. This can actually boost ROE by reducing excess equity, making the company look more efficient.

NB: Came across this research which explains in more detail why Pre-IPO dividend is not as bad as you think [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664)

# The IPO will be undersubscribed

Well- Data suggests otherwise. The IPO is already over 40% subscribed. As of writing this post, DIIs (Domestic Mutual Funds and AMCs) have still NOT placed their Bids (They usually come in on the last day). The IPO has similar subscription to Paytm (and other IPOs this size) after 2 days. Given the trends in past IPO subscriptions, it is fair to assume this IPO will be full subscribed and may be oversubscribed by up to 2x.

Even if it doesn't hit 3-4x oversubscription, filling up the subscription is still a win, especially since Hyundai is raising a massive $3.3 billion USD.

(NB: If you want to check this data for yourself, head over to: [https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active](https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active) then click Bid details and select ""Consolidated Bids"". Make sure you are not only looking at the NSE Bids.)

# Grey Market Premium (GMP)

Even though GMP has dropped, it never went below zero. It has always stayed a premium and never became a discount. This shows steady interest and suggests the IPO is priced fairly—not overpriced or underpriced.

Unlike many IPOs that rely on discounts to attract buyers, Hyundai’s valuation means the listing price should align closely with the offer price, reflecting true value. If you only apply to IPOs for listing gains- This isn't an IPO for you.

# A side note

One of the biggest issues with the Indian stock market is that the Breath of the market is not increasing as fast as the Depth. More and more capital is pouring in but the number of large companies isn't increasing at the same speed. Given the IPOs that have been coming out at such a huge discount recently all giving amazing listing gains, I could imagine why this is a turn off that Hyundai decided to list themselves at fair market value. But IPOs aren't meant for a listing gain. They are to take a company public, which this one seems to be successful in doing.

# --- Edit ---

**Appreciate all the feedback. Someone even texted me and called me Mr. Hyundai Man which I found hilarious. A few common points I missed seem to be brought up by multiple people, so I wanted to address these.**

# The Royalty

So, yes. There is a Royalty.

But guess what? Every foreign company with an Indian subsidiary does this. Why? Are they trying to loot India? No. This is the payment for maintaining the brand. Any spend Hyundai Korea does to polish the Hyundai brand benefits Hyundai India and this is the payment for that. The royalty is capped at 5%. This isn't anything insane and many other MNCs - including Toyota India (which is currently private), Bosch, Schaeffler India and Wabco India - pay royalty payments to their parent companies. A couple interesting ones are:

|Company|Cap on Royalty to Parent for Brand|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India|4.5%|They tried to increase it recently but the shareholders rejected the resolution.|
|Maruti Suzuki|5%||

Now, the Cap doesn't always mean this much money will be payed out. In FY23, Maruti paid 3.75% royalty to Suzuki motors. At one point in time, the royalty used to be above 6-6.5% before coming down to the 5% cap now in place. So, I ask you this-

**If Maruti Suzuki has a 5% royalty, why is Hyundai India's 5% not justified? I would argue that ""Maruti"" has a brand value within India which may be sustainable without Suzuki. Hyundai is Hyundai and without the name, it has no alternative.**

Hyundai India benefits much more from this royalty deal than Maruti Suzuki does. Yet for some reason, people think Hyundai is ""Greedy"" and Suzuki are Saints.

# Mini IPO? 75% promoter shareholding rule

Someone in the comments said ""the parent company has to offload an additional 7.5% stake in the coming six months to reach the max 75% promoter holding"". This is partly true that 7.5% additional stake needs to be offloaded but not in the next 6 months. This will take place in 3-5 years ([Source](https://www.autocarpro.in/news/hyundai-india-to-dilute-75-additional-stake-in-3-5-years-122999)). This would be 1-2% additional free float every year something the markets can easily handle while increasing liquidity for the stock (speculation alert) potentially propelling Hyundai India into the F&O Category.

It is in **Hyundai's best interest to do this as slowly as possible too**. If they were to crash the price of the Indian subsidiary, Hyundai Korea's books would show fewer assets. To keep their own book inflated, they will make sure this happens responsibly. **They aren't selling and running away, they will still own 75% of the company.**

# So you are actually saying Hyundai India is a Buy?

Absolutely NOT. The purpose of this post is not to tell you to buy or not. It was to show the facts. The decision to BUY is yours. People seemed to have reached the conclusion that Hyundai is Bad with incomplete facts.

It is funny how people have a problem with things from Royalty to Valuation. Funny part is, from the looks of it, Hyundai India tried to copy Maruti Suzuki. And this makes sense! They are following a very similar business model here. In fact, Suzuki Motors is much worse of without Maruti Suzuki compared to Hyundai Korea without Hyundai India.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Tomorrow Market Prediction: Simple Insights and a Real Plan for September 23, 2025 Hey there! Welcome back to Replete Equities. As always, I want you and me to look at the market’s ups and downs together and find out what matters for YOU—because that’s what counts. Let’s keep it simple, practical, and focus on a trading plan you can actually use tomorrow.

How Was the Market Today? Quick Recap
Let’s talk about what really happened. Today, the Nifty 50 dropped by about 125 points and ended at 25,202. The Sensex also slipped by 466 points, closing at 82,160.

Why? Honestly, it felt like a day when people wanted to lock in some profits—especially after the market recently climbed higher. The big story was all about the IT sector (think TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Wipro)—they fell because the US increased H-1B visa fees, making investors nervous about their future costs. Even big names like Reliance and Tata Motors weren’t safe from selling.

But (and here’s the bright spot!) some shares like Adani Enterprises, Bajaj Finance, and UltraTech Cement did quite well. Still, smaller and mid-sized stocks weren’t spared—profit booking was everywhere. Plus, the India VIX (I call this the market’s “nervous meter”) jumped up by nearly 6%, so expect some more bumpy rides ahead.

Here’s What to Watch: Clear Support & Resistance Levels
I know numbers can get confusing. Let’s keep it straightforward—here’s what I’ll watch with you tomorrow, using the latest data:

For Nifty 50
Support:
I see 25,200 as the first “safety net.” If things get more volatile, then 25,100 is the backup, and really watch out for 25,000 if the mood turns negative.

Resistance:
On the way up, 25,350 to 25,400 is the main hurdle right now as a lot of call options are expiring here—so it’ll take some work for Nifty to cross this range. If you do see a breakout, watch for 25,450 as the next area that could slow things down, thanks to heavy call writing.

My view? The Nifty could bounce from support, but unless we see a strong move above those resistance levels (and big volumes), I wouldn’t bet big on a big up day.

For Bank Nifty
Closed at 55,459 today.

Support: 55,000 is the most important “floor” for now. If it slips, then 54,800 catches my attention. These levels have a good cushion from put option buyers showing up strong.

Resistance: Resistance is around 55,300 to 55,400 as call writers are active, and if we get a strong move above, then look for action all the way to 56,000.

If you see Bank Nifty break cleanly above resistance, that’s a good sign. But if it falls below those support levels, it might be best to stand aside for a bit.

What Are Options Telling Us? (Kept Simple!)
Let’s stay real—option chain activity tells us what the bigger traders expect for tomorrow’s range:

In Nifty, the main “fight” is between 25,100 (lots of support—many puts) and 25,350-25,400 (lots of resistance—many calls). The market is likely to stay between these zones for now, as neither side has a clear win.

Heavy call option open interest at 25,400 makes this a stubborn resistance.

At the same time, open interest near 25,200 and support at 25,100 means many buyers are ready below.

The PCR (put-call ratio) is pretty neutral right now, showing neither the bulls nor the bears have a major upper hand.

For Bank Nifty, the action is similar:

Support at 55,000–54,800, resistance at 55,300–55,400, and next-level resistance near 56,000.

No strong trend yet—so range trading is still the safest approach.

Summary: Don’t expect the market to go wild unless you see a real breakout past these numbers. It’s a “wait, react, and protect your profits” kind of day.

Hot Topics and Headlines YOU Should Know
Here’s what really moved the market and might matter tomorrow:

US visa fee hike put pressure on IT shares. If more news drops, expect more drama there.

Some foreign investors picked up Indian stocks, especially hoping for good company profits soon.

India’s tax changes (GST) and a stable monsoon could quietly support the market in the weeks to come.

The US cut rates again, which sometimes makes global investors bolder in buying stocks.

Tomorrow, there’s no major IPO launching, but company splits (like Adani Power) could shake up some prices.

How I’d Plan MY Trades for Tomorrow (And How You Can Too!)
Here’s my real, personal plan for Tomorrow Market Prediction:

Nifty Range: I plan to buy if Nifty goes near 25,200 or even 25,100, with a stop below 25,000. I’ll only get aggressive if Nifty powers above 25,400 and stays there.

Bank Nifty: I’ll be careful if it drops below 55,000. If it pushes up through 55,400 and holds, then I might look for buys, potentially all the way to 56,000.

Stock Sectors: I’ll still stay away from IT for now—too much uncertainty with those visa headlines. Instead, I’ll keep my focus on sectors like consumption, industry, and companies that people still need even when things get shaky.

Market Sentiment: With VIX up, I’d use safer strategies. I won’t take big risks—just trade the range, protect profits, and wait for a clearer breakout.

The biggest lesson? Don’t force any trade—patience is profitable!

Final Thoughts—My Honest Take
Markets will always have their scary days and sideways moves. If you and I stick with our plan, cut losses quickly, and size up only when things are super clear, we’ll do better over time.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"4 years of applying to IPOs, taking out the principal, and keeping the profits for life. Current value of those profits: ~450k This is a follow-up to my [2024 post on another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1etkbad/3_years_of_applying_to_ipos_taking_out_the/).

I have been subscribing to IPOs (retail only) since 2021 and since the start I fixed the strategy: exit on listing regardless of the outcome. Take out the principal and keep the profit for lifetime. 

I have to admit I have deviated from that rule since last year and I have kept stocks like Tata Capital, Tata Tech, Bajaj HFL, etc. This is because I feel they'll do better in the long run. The Hyundai holding was an error and it proved good and so did the lone Kalpataru share.

I have 3 retail accounts (across me and my immediate family), so the first 3 images are from my family holdings. These demat accounts are only for IPOs, save the SETNIF50 holding you see in an image.

I do top-level research to form an opinion on all IPOs but over these 4 years, I have seen that markets are irrational. So, some bets go wrong, like for the ones listed below. Even then, impossible allotments like that of Jinkushal Industries recently results in negative listing. Which is why I have continued to stick to my strategy with the hope that in the long run, most of these keep growing. You can read more about my strategy on that other post.

While you don't see the discount listing issues here, I have listed them here: CarTrade, Nuvoco Vistas, Aptus, Sansera Engineering, ABSL AMC, PB Fintech, SJS Enterprises, PayTM, AGS Transact, Rainbow Children's Medicare, LIC, Keystone Realtors, Uniparts India, Digvi, Avalon Tech, Maoj Vaibhav, Updater Services, IRM Energy, Muthoot Microfin, Jana SFB, R K Swamy, Gopal Namkeen, Aadhar Housing Finance, Brigade Hotel Ventures, Leela, Ather Energy, Ajax Engineering, Carraro, and Hyundai. The total loss would be shy of about 80k.

Some stats:

* Out of the 631 applications across 3 retail accounts, I have been allotted 125 times. That's about 22% success rate
* If I didn't sell the allotted lots, I would be setting on a profit of 650k
* My best performing IPO is: IREDA (380%)
* My worst performing IPO is: TARSONS (-55%)",1760537639.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7c5e2
Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Algo Trading in India: Leveraging Market News for Better Trades Hey guys, I have curated some news articles for my trading setup today. Here’s what caught my eye:

1. Indian Bank and HFCL among 9 F&O stocks saw a high increase in futures open interest. This indicates heightened trading activity and potential volatility. I’m considering selling straddles if the implied volatility remains elevated.

2. Manas Polymers and Energies IPO to list on Monday, with no GMP seen ahead of debut. This lack of grey market premium suggests a cautious market sentiment. I might stay on the sidelines for this one unless I see a strong opening.

3. Advance Agrolife IPO allotment status is out today. This might create some movement in the relevant sectors. I’ll be watching for any unusual volume spikes to decide if there’s an entry opportunity.

4. Two to Tango: Tata Capital and LG IPOs expected to siphon liquidity, starving secondary markets. This could mean reduced trading opportunities in the broader market. I’m thinking of focusing on IPOs this week as they might present better setups.

5. Bajaj Finance shares in focus after AUM grows 24% YoY in Q2 update. This promising growth can lead to bullish sentiment in the financial sector. I’m considering going long on Bajaj Finance if the momentum continues.

I use daily news to scan potential stocks, and if they fall within my algo setups, I take the trade. Curious if anyone else does this.",1759722363.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nz8tlh/algo_trading_in_india_leveraging_market_news_for/

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Laxmi Dental IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Based on the below parameters, the IPO has been reviewed:

**1. Strong Company Fundamentals**

Laxmi Dental is a leading dental healthcare provider in India, offering a range of dental services including dental implants, orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry, and more. The company has a pan-India presence with a network of clinics.

The company's revenue grew by 19.75% from ₹161.63 crore in FY23 to ₹193.56 crore in FY24. Even better is that the profits saw a remarkable turnaround, from ₹4.16 crore loss in FY23 to a profit of ₹25.23 crore in FY24, marking an improvement of 706.49%.

The company has also announced that it has secured ₹314 crore from anchor investors ahead of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹407 - ₹428 per share

**2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors**

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion of Laxmi Dental remains undersubscribed with only 0.44 times subscribed or 0.59 times, according to various sources.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

As of Laxmi Dental, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (MF), ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Kotak MF, Mirae Asset MF, Tata MF, Birla Sunlife Insurance, Max Life Insurance, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, Al Mehwar Commercial Investments and Natixis Investment Managers are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

**3. Issue size and split**

The fresh issue size should preferably not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Laxmi Dental's ₹698.06 Cr worth IPO consists of fresh issuance of 0.32 crore equity shares worth ₹138.00 crores and offer for sale of 1.31 crore shares aggregating to Rs 560.06 crores. The split here is 19% fresh issue and 81% OFS. Less than 50% fresh issue is a mediocre number and doesn't bring much credibility to the IPO.

**4. Brand name and experienced Management**

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

Laxmi Dental's leadership team comprises individuals with extensive experience in the dental industry:

* **Mr. Rajesh Khakhar and Mr. Sameer Merchant:** Founder Mr. Khakhar along with co-founder Mr. Merchant has been instrumental and played a pivotal role in providing advanced orthodontic solutions, contributing significantly to the company's growth and bringing advancements in Digital Dentistry and introducing new technologies.

**5. Attractive Valuation**

At the upper price band company is valuing at a P/E of 94.11x. Also based on FY24 earnings, the P/E ratio rises to 130.87, indicating that the issue is priced aggressively. 

As per the high valuation, the earnings and profits growth also have to grow similarly so that the valuation is justified.

**6. Use of proceeds**

The company plans to utilize ₹138 crore from the fresh issue to support several strategic objectives, including the repayment or prepayment, in full or part, of certain outstanding borrowings by the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Additionally, as per the RHP, funds will be allocated toward capital expenditure requirements, such as the acquisition of new machinery for the company and its subsidiary, Bizdent Devices Private Limited. The rest of the amount will be utilized by the company for general corporate purposes.

**Verdict:**

The IPO is worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736856511.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i14mp2/laxmi_dental_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth_diving_in/
Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Wanted to know your thoughts on my current investment portfolio and how I can make it better! Hello all!

Just a beginner here (both on reddit and the stock market) asking for some suggestions.

I've strated investing only recently (around 6 months ago). Currently my portfolio looks like -

Motilal Oswal midcap (₹6k PM),
Tata small cap fund (₹6k PM),
Icici prudential bluechip prudential fund (₹500 PM),
Quant ELSS tax saver fund (₹500 PM),
PGMI india midcap opportunities fund (₹4k PM),
Navi nifty 50 index fund (₹2.5k PM).

I'm thinking of thinning it down since before I was a little clueless and I'm now checking the expense ratio, sharpe ration, etc (not sure if I'm correct here though?)

Motilal Oswal Midcap (₹6k),
Tata smallcap fund (₹6k),
Nippon India large cap (₹6k),
Very small quantities in Quant and icici bluechip (since they're just consistently in red) - keeping it at 500 each.

Need a suggestion for one or two more SIPs that I can invest into? I can afford to invest 5-6k more

Apart from this I've also invested in a few small cases -

Pharma tracker by windmill capital,
Equity and Gold (SIPd),
All weather investing (SIPd),
Top 100 stocks.

I'm not sure if smallcase would be the best way to go with investing into stocks though. Also I've recently even gotten the VMM IPO and I've also applied for Mamath Machinery IPO and Senores pharmaceuticals IPO.

Apologies for the long post but just wanted to know your thoughts on how it looks like and how can I improve it. (Currently both the overall stocks and SIP portfolio in green, not by much though)

Thanksss!",1734623485.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hhvv1p/wanted_to_know_your_thoughts_on_my_current/
Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Standard Glass Lining IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are from personal observations. I’m not a SEBI-registered investor, kindly do your research before making investment decisions.

Last minute quick IPO analysis

1. Strong Company Fundamentals

Standard Glass Lining Technology provides a wide range of solutions that cover design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, installation, commissioning, and the establishment of standard operating procedures for pharmaceutical and chemical producers on a turnkey basis.

The company's revenue grew from ₹240.2 crore in FY22 to ₹543.7 crore in FY24, reflecting a CAGR of 50.5%. Similarly, PAT increased from ₹25.1 crore to ₹60.0 crore, with a CAGR of 55%, supported by its strategic partnerships and inorganic acquisitions.

Standard Glass Lining announced that it has secured ₹123 crore from anchor investors in advance of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹133 - ₹140 per share.

2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of the closing day of IPO, QIBs oversubscribed by issue by 4.67 times.

But it's also important to track and make sure that QIBs show early interest in the IPO instead of pitching in the list minute.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

In this case ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), Kotak MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, 3P Investment Managers, Kotak Infinity Fund - Class AC, ITI MF, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amansa Holdings, and Clarus Capital are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

However, a contrary example here is One97 IPO (Paytm), which had interest from several American players such as Vanguard and even Warren Buffet. However, many of them sold major portions of their investments, and Paytm’s share price is now several times lower than the listing price.

3. Issue size and split

It is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Standard Glass Lining Technology's ₹410.05 crore-worth IPO consists of a fresh issuance of equity shares worth ₹210 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to 1.43 crore shares worth Rs. 200.05 crores by its promoters and other selling stakeholders. More than 50% fresh issue is a decent number and brings credibility to the IPO.

4. Brand name and experienced Management

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

SGTL has experienced people in the management such as:

Mr. Nageswara Rao Kandula: Managing Director with over three decades of experience in creating glass-lined products that meet international standards for various chemically aggressive applications.

Mrs. Krishna Veni Kandula: Executive Director contributing to the company's strategic direction and operations.

Mr. Venkata Mohana Rao Katragadda: Executive Director involved in overseeing the company's engineering and manufacturing processes.

5. Attractive Valuation

At the upper price band company is valuing at P/E of 43.01x (against an industry average of 52x), with an EV/EBITDA of 30.08x and market cap of ₹2792 crores.

This reasonable valuation relative to its peers is a huge green flag.

6. Use of proceeds

The company plans to use ₹130 crore from the fresh issue to repay debts and allocate ₹30 crore for investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, S2 Engineering Industry.

Clearly defined use of proceeds is another reason to invest in the IPO.

Verdict: After a long time, we see an IPO that's worth applying. 100% worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736329987.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hwgjv3/standard_glass_lining_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth/

5. Points to consider



**Business**  
  
Hyundai Motor India (HMI) is a part of the Hyundai Motor Co (HMC) Group, **third largest auto OEM in the world in CY2023 and 2nd largest domestic auto OEM in the Indian passenger vehicles market** according to the CRISIL Report, operate through 13 vehicle models. **They are the largest exporter of PV from India**. HMI contributed 18% of HMC's global sales in CY 23. They aim to become an export hub for HMC for exports to emerging markets including South Asia, Latin America, Africa and Middle East through 82 international distributors.  
  
**Hyundai operates through Chennai plant having annual capacity of 8,24,000 as on FY24.** 90% of parts are localized, procured from India. New plant at Talegaon is coming up by FY26 which will increase capacity to 994,000 units and when fully operational 1,074,000 units. Hyundai derives its competitive strength in R&D and exports from capabilities of HMC.  
  
Hyundai also has pre-owned car program under “Hyundai Promise”, through which Hyundai passenger vehicles that are up to 10 years old can be certified and backed by warranties to facilitate resale.  
Hyundai provides warranty of 3 years or 1 lakh kms.  
  
**Products**  
  
Hyundai has 13 models across vehicle segments  
  
**Sedans**  
-Aura( Petrol/ Petrol, CNG)  
-Verna  
  
**Hatchbacks**  
-Grand i10 NIOS ( Petrol/ Petrol, CNG)

Tucson (Petrol/Diesel)  
IONIQ 5  


**EV development**  
  
HMC’s diversified EV portfolio across battery EVs, hybrid EV, plug-in hybrid EVs, mild hybrid EVs and fuel cell EVs will be a key enabler for HMI's EV strategies, combined with skill of developing localized ICE engines by HMI. Beyond EV manufacturing, Hyundai aims to develop the EV infrastructure in India by constructing charging stations across cities and highways.

**Industry overview**  
  
  
The Global PV sales in CY2023 was dominated by Toyota Group at 11.1 million, followed by Volkswagen Group with 9.2 million units and Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai + Kia) with 7.3 million units, with **Hyundai group being 3rd largest global passenger vehicle ( PV) maker.**  
  
**According to CRISIL MI&A, India had 26 cars per 1,000 people as of Fiscal 2024.** Although the penetration grew from 22 cars per 1000 people in Fiscals 2019 to 26 cars as of Fiscal 2024, it is significantly lower than the developed nations and even emerging nations like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. This provides significant headroom for growth, especially given the expected increase in disposable incomes, faster economic growth, younger population, and increased focus from international OEMs.  
  
As per CRISIL MI&A, Indian economy is expected to surpass US$5 trillion mark over the next seven fiscals (2025- 2031) and inching closer to US$7 trillion. A projected average GDP growth of 6.7% in this period will make India the third-largest economy in the world and lift per capita income to the upper middle-income category. **By Fiscal 2031, India’s per capita income will rise to approximately US$4,500, thereby making it an upper middle-income nation.**  
  
Between FY19 and FY24 , India’s domestic PV sales volume rose at 5% CAGR. This growth was despite the sales contraction (at 10% CAGR) witnessed during Fiscals 2019 to 2021. Sales were 3.9 million vehicles in Fiscal 2023. **CRISIL MI&A expects the industry to clock 4.5-6.5% CAGR between FY24 to FY29 period to reach 5.2-5.7 million domestic vehicle sales.**  
  
**Premiumization trend in Cars**

B/w FY21 and FY23 , car industry by value increased by 36% due to- premiumization- preference of SUVs- increase in prices due to emission norms-raw material price hike

**ASP( Avg selling price) rose from 491000rs to 659000rs b/w FY19 and FY23.**  
  
**Segment share of SUVs rose from 23% to 50% in FY24 at 23% CAGR.** Recognizing the changing consumer preferences, OEMs also launched higher number of vehicles in the SUV segment. The mid-size SUV segment (24% CAGR) outpaced the entire SUV segment. Continued traction for the high selling models like Hyundai Creta & Kia Seltos as well as Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Urban cruiser Hyryder, and Honda Elevate provided the thrust to the growth of mid-size SUVs. **The share of small cars (hatchbacks) reduced from 46.9% in Fiscal 2019 to 34.4% in Fiscal 2023.**  
  
The hatchbacks segment lost market share owing to  
- lack of new model launches  
-frequent hikes in vehicle prices  
-increase in operating costs amid fuel price hikes  
-an unfavourable macroeconomic environment that impacted the price sensitive entry-level customer base  
  
  
Domestic PV industry is an oligopolistic market with few players dominating the entire industry. Maruti Suzuki is the market leader ,Hyundai Motor India second largest contributor to the domestic sales, followed by Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. These 4 players together contribute approximately 80% of the market.

**Operating metrics**  
  
Hyundai has sold following number of cars in FY24-  
ICE 506,250  
CNG 60,320  
EV 975  
  
Hyundai has lost some share in the hatchbacks segment in the last 5 years. Discontinuation of its compact hatchbacks Santro and Eon impacted the company’s share within the hatchbacks segment. Intensified competition with entry of new models Tata Altroz and Toyota Glanza in the premium hatchbacks segment exerted pressure on its share in the premium hatchbacks sub-segment in the last 5 years.  
  
In the compact sedans segment, Maruti Suzuki leads with a market share of approximately 58.5%, from the Dzire model. **Following Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai holds a share of around 19.8%, attributed to Aura model.** **In the premium sedans segment, Hyundai Motor India dominates with a 31.2% market share**, driven by sale of its only model Verna.  
  
Compared to other segments, the SUV segment is much more fragmented with no clear leader and very close competition between the OEMs. Hyundai dominates the mid-size SUV sub segment. **With its flagship model Creta, Hyundai commanded a leading 30% market share.**  
  
**Hyundai has more than 1,350 sales touchpoints across India.** Maruti Suzuki has about 3,250 touchpoints in India. **Hyundai has 1500 service touchpoints**, while Maruti has 4,560 service touchpoints. In terms of sales+ service touchpoints, Hyundai is 2nd largest after Maruti.  
  
Maruti leads the industry with PV market share of 41.3%. Hyundai used to be undisputed 2nd player for long, **but currently at 14.6% market share** where Tata Motors is breathing at its shoulders with 14% market share.  
Operating margins are higher for Mahindra at 12.3% due to being an only SUV player.

Cost of materials consumed 72.6% of revenues.  
  
**Balance sheet**  
  
Trade receivables 2900cr ( revenues 61440cr) negligible.  
Trade payables 7440cr  
Inventory 3420cr.  
Like other auto OEMs, Hyundai operates in negative working capital.

Debt to equity 0.06 ( Maruti 0.02, Tata 0.84, Mahindra 0.11)  
Provisions 1250cr.  
  
Net cashflow from operations 8700cr.





**Points to consider**  


Entire Auto industry is standing at crossroads to move on towards renewable energy like EV, CNG, Hybrid- so lot of technological change related investments has to be made by all players in coming few years. It is not clear which technology will emerge as winner, so incumbents must invest in all of them.  
  
**Top 5 suppliers constitute 44% of materials and top 10 suppliers constitute 59% of materials.17% of parts are sourced from Korea.**

**Hyundai has to pay 3.5% of revenues as royalty cost to HMC for R&D and manufacturing technology transfer.**  
  
Related party transactions in expenses side is 32% and 9% on the sales side.  
  
**HMC holds 34.16% stake in Kia Corporation** which operates in the automobile industry in India through its subsidiary, Kia India Private Limited. HMC’s chairman is also the chairman of Kia. HMI also supplies engines to Kia for their vehicles. Given the potential product overlaps between HMI's offerings and those of Kia in India, there is no assurance that conflicts of interest won't happen in future.  
  
12% of sales come from Middle East/Europe , 7% of sales come from Latin America, 4% from Africa, **so dependence on Exports is there for 23% of revenues.**  
  
**Capacity utilization in 9M FY24 is 97% , so until Talegaon plant comes up ( H2 FY26), there is capacity constraints for Hyundai**.  
  
They depend on subsidiary Mobis India for spare parts supplies.",1720895392.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1e2h9lu/hyundai_ipo_analysis/

Hola Everyone,  
I've just started investing this month and my portfolio seems to be profitable. Any thoughts on how should i proceed further in my investment journey?

**Reasons behind investing**: I am 21 M solely investing into stocks with a thought process of holding my assets for long term (retirement or till 30 Age).

**Some newbie analysis**:

* **HDFC (Avg:1458)** : Bought for long term gains, Key reasons behind buying was multiple new branch openings, Multinational tie-ups (Singapore to be latest).
* **IREDA (Avg: 185)** : Govt's Major focus on Renewable energy, HAs enough space to grow in the next 6 years. And even at 5x the IPO price, it will be a company under 50k crore market capitalization. Since stock market is forward looking, it is possible that big funds will also go long on this much before than the actual value of the company reaches there. And the size of the company is small enough for it to get influenced by the big funds.
* **Tata Motors/Power (Avg: 864 / 356)**: No analysis done as of, One of my old friend who's experienced in trading for over 24 years recommended me to buy.
* **IRFC (Avg. 178)**: Hopped on the hype train and bought them on high levels. Regretting the decision and holding them till post election to see some gains.

**Mutual Funds:** I've invested in 3 mutual funds (2 SIP, 1Lump Sum) as well:

* Aditya Birla Sun Life PSU Equity Fund Direct Growth: Lump Sum (55,000).
* Kotak Emerging Equity Fund: SIP (5000)
* Axis Small Cap Fund: SIP (5000)

Need some advice on whether i am walking on right path or should sell some of my positions to prevent unfortunate future losses.

PS: I read some random comment on reddit regarding the investment rules one should follow.

Step 1: Buy stock  
Step 2: Buy More  
Step 3: Watch the market fall and Buy Again on Dips!  
Step4: Watch your investment grow in next 10

Although i am a newbie to this game, above rules make sense to me. Thoughts?",1707050813.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ain50y/newbie_investor_here_asking_for_some_advice_on/

Is applying in all these categories a good idea? I'm concerned about whether this might lead to potential rejection due to multiple applications.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Why I think IREDA will be a multi-bagger with 300% potential I think IREDA is a Multi-bagger stock that can grow by 300-400% in around 1-2years. Here are my reasons.

This is **not** a copy-paste, but entirely my own research. Source of most of the company data is Red Herring Prospectus available [here](https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/nov-2023/indian-renewable-energy-development-agency-limited-rhp_79087.html) but other relvent info is my personal research and understanding of the industry.

This is shared for educational purposes. Both mine and yours. I had no plans to write this, but when I researched and wrote points for my own investment, it become detailed enough that I thought of putting slightly more effort and making it into an article.

# Business model

&#x200B;

* IREDA is a central govt company made in 1987 to specifically give loans to renewable energy projects in India.
* Currently, it is the largest renewable energy financing company in India and have given out loans nearing 50000crores.
* IREDA's business is quite simple to understand yet many do not understand. They basically takes loans at 6.23% interest and then use that money to give loans to big renewable energy projects at average interest of around 10%, thus profiting 4% of everything they borrow!
* It is beneficial for companies that take these loans too as 10% is still a much lower interest rate than many other business loans from other sources. Thus win-win.
* People see the large debt and is wary of investing in a company with debt, that maybe true for normal companies but not for finance companies. Here they are all very good debt and this is exactly how all financial companies make money. More debt means more money to lend, and make more money.
* Their borrowing rate is the lowest among their peers. They borrow about half from domestic sources like RBI and bonds and the other half from foreign green investors including Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Asian Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement and the World Bank.
* The average cost of borrowing of IREDA is 6.23% in 2023. Other financing companies like REC limited have 6.96% and Power Finance Corporation Limited have 7.1% interest for the loans they borrow. Being able to borrow for such low rates, even less than Fixed-Deposits is the biggest advantage for a finance company.

&#x200B;

[The largest solar farm in the world is in Bhadla, Rajasthan. Funded partially by IREDA.](https://preview.redd.it/rpa6taypzv2c1.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c4930fab9dde7431ec802b622872eaa8233db18)

&#x200B;

# Why Low risk

# 

* Their main customers are large solar power plants and wind mills. More than 46% of their customers have made a legal agreement with the government(PPA) for the price at which govt will buy electricity from them. This is a permanent agreement that cannot be altered. This agreement was done to encourage renewable energy investments in India.
* So, a company that started in 2014 may have an agreement to sell electricity at a higher rate than a company that started in 2019 because cost of investment was higher in 2014.
* This basically guarantees profits no matter which year a renewable energy company was started as this fixed price means these solar/wind companies are guaranteed to get revenue from govt and thus guaranteed to pay their loans. There have been couple of instances of state govts wanting to get out of this agreement like in Andra Pradesh, but the govt eventually lost the case in court.
* The Andhra Pradesh high court gave order in 2022 that power contracts cannot be renegotiated and asked the state to clear dues estimated at Rs 30,000 crore to renewable energy generators in six weeks.
* But apart from that 93.4% of the loans are secured with collateral, so if the company is unable to pay in the worst case, IREDA can liquidate their collateral to recover money.
* 99.6% of the loan taking customers have taken compulsory insurance against natural disasters like Earthquake, flood, cyclone etc. So, there is no risk from disasters.
* 94.3% of the loans are given on floating interest rate, meaning the interest-payment is linked to inflation, thus there is no inflation risk to IREDA.
* 20 biggest customers account for 40% of the total loans given.
* IREDA has given loans in 23 states, so the political risk is spread across India.
* Only 1.66% of the loans given have turned out to be Non performing assets(NPAs). The net NPAs exhibited improvement, decreasing from 3.12% to 1.66% in FY23
* Out of this 1.6%, more than 70% were the loans given to Biomass plants and hydro plants, both of which were a learning experience for the company. The solar and wind are the main areas of expected growth in next 6 years, so I think NPA percentage will further come down.

# Why high value

# 

* Generally, Govt PSUs are huge companies in the 50k+ range market cap. But this one is a 8k market cap company. It is basically a government startup that is in a highly lucrative field that is about to blow up.
* Government companies are generally inefficient at doing complicated projects. Like HAL has to make fighterjets. Mazagon have to make ships.  All of them are too complicated, and easy for govt company to messup. But here it is a simple business model with low number of employees required.
* They just have 175 employees, but with an average experience of 18years! Basically like a startup, but focused on one thing only.
* Government companies that has too many customers are also generally inefficient like Air India, Railways or BSNL. But, here they have one of the lowest number of customers. Thus it is easy for a govt company to manage and give good service.
* Govt is currently looking to monetize its companies and earn dividends every year. So, new guidelines says all central public sector enterprise are required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth. IREDA is a profit making company for a long time. Thus, it will give good dividend in future too.
* Govt companies generally lists showing their actual value, and is not incentivized to list at blown up valuations. Here the net worth of the company is 6,580 crore. And the market cap is 8600 crore at Rs32 per share. Considering stock market is forward looking, there is huge scope for growth.
* India has committed to make 500GW of renewable energy by 2030. That is MASSIVE. India's total energy consumption from all sources currently is for example 190GW.
* India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 70.10 GW as of July 2023
* IREDA was the financier of 22GW of renewable energy in India as of now including partially financing the largest solar power plant in the world.
* Prime minister Modi had infused 1500 crore just last year into IREDA to fast up the growth of renewable energy. This shows clear govt support for this company. But anyway my point is that 1500 crore out of 6500 crore networth of the company is direct funds from last year given for free by govt.
* Even after this IPO, 75% of the stock will still be owned by the central government, thus they are committed in the growth of this company.
* IREDA also fully owns a 50MW solar power plant in Kerala that generates 28crore per year revenue.

&#x200B;

# The current timing is awesome

&#x200B;

* 58000 crore worth of money was used to apply for IREDA IPO of just 2150 crore. Last week saw the biggest IPOs of this year. 5 IPOs that came in the week totaling 2.6lakh crore, total of 2.6lakh crore were invested. This is largest amount ever invested in a week in Indian history.
* Among these 5 stocks, IREDA will be the first to get listed, and there is  gap for others to be listed.
* More than 2.5lakh crore of this locked-up capital will be unfrozen just before IREDA is listed.
* This can cause it to show unprecedented demand when all of these people who have not got any IPO will look at buying the first IPO that got listed.
* But it will take people some time to realize this value, and stocks are forward looking, so I think in around 1-2years people will realize the potential and the price will skyrocket.
* Two years ago a similar PSU company IRFC which lends money to Railways went for IPO. It was priced at 26 rupees. But got listed at a loss of 3.5%. Its share price increase to 90 when people realized its value.
* IRFC was only subscribed 3x by QIBs. This time IREDA is 104x subscription from QIBs. There is clear interests from banks, mutual funds and govt institutions for investing in IREDA with long term view.
* IRFC lends only to railways. The scope of IREDA is substantially bigger, and is at the right time when renewable has finally become viable.
* Currently there is a trend of PSUs generally skyrocketing few years after IPO. Look at what happened to Irfc, Rvnl, IRCTC and Mazgaon.

# Growth

IREDA has enough space to grow in the next 6 years. And even at 5x the IPO price, it will be a company under 50k crore market capitalization. Since stock market is forward looking, it is possible that big funds will also go long on this much before than the actual value of the company reaches there.  And the size of the company is small enough for it to get influenced by the big funds.

&#x200B;

₹32 - 8.6k crore

₹64 - 17.2k crore

₹96 - 25.8k crore

₹160 - 43k crore

&#x200B;

This is a highly scalable data-driven business with very low risk of lending. Like, you know exactly what a solar panel will cost, and how much money it will produce over the years, so you are unlikely to give bad loans. In other financing companies, the risk is high like if you give loans to an airline or for making an ebike manufacturing factory, or give out personal loans, data is not the same for each loan-taker even in same industry. So, it is possible one ebike company makes profit while other do not. But that is not the case with solar or wind energy.

In one way I am happy I am getting to buy this stock at undervalued prices, but I am also mad at the government for selling 25% stake in such a profit making good company for loot prices. They could have got full subscription even at double the price. So, why sell low?

In general, this looks like a very good stock for long term value investing. There are so many upsides but very little downsides. I am going for long in this one.

Reddit,wework ipo,"IPO debacle and lessons learnt from it The recent Wework India IPO was a disaster in the making from the very beginning. As was expected, the listing gain was negative 2% today. Probably one of the worst IPOs Indian Stock Market has seen in this year. The company priced its shares too high, there were governance issues and promoters were embroiled in legal battles. All in all the long term viability of this company is seriously questionable. With losses in balance sheet, any analyst will instantly come to know that this IPO is not to make money but to offload risk.

I have come across several observations regarding such poor IPOs - 

  
1) IPOs have Book running lead managers (BRLMs) who function as not only agents of the company on stock exchanges but also perform the function of underwriting any risks related to the IPO.

  
2) BRLMs for wework india IPO were - JM Financials, ICICI Securities, Jefferies, Kotak Mahindra Capital and 360 one WAM. These BRLMs have been highly aggressive in listing companies on mainboard. 

  
3) Anchor Investors for the IPO were [these](https://www.chittorgarh.net/reports/anchor-investor/wework-india-intimation_anchor-allocation_wework.pdf).   
  
(To name a few - ICICI PRUDENTIAL TECHNOLOGY FUND, HDFC MUTUAL FUND - HDFC BUSINESS CYCLE FUND, HDFC MUTUAL FUND - HDFC INNOVATION FUND ,HDFC VALUE FUND, HDFC TRUSTEE COMPANY LTD, HDFC BALANCED ADVANTAGE FUND.)  
  
Anchor investors were subsidiaries of these BRLMs or their associate. It's clear that underwriters themselves asked their sister concerns to invest in this IPO. 

  
4) This is not the first time this has happened. [Ceigall India IPO](https://www.chittorgarh.net/reports/anchor-investor/ceigall_anchor_allocation_report.pdf) experienced something similar. My investment has almost halved from Rs 400 to cmp Rs 250 because I bought that company for long term, seeing the confidence of these big names as anchor investors in that IPO too. And guess who the underwriters in that offer were - ICICI Securities, JM Financial and same registrar MUFG Intime.  

What I learnt from it? 

1. There is clear conflict of interest when underwriter is himself the buyer.

What they have done is actually rigged the game well in advance -

* set the price band,
* Underwrite the issue (and must fill shortfall if undersubscribed),
* Invested in it themselves -  with **client (mutual fund) money**, not their own.

That’s not a vote of confidence, it’s **self-dealing** under the guise of “institutional support.”

2) BRLMs saved the IPO from getting cancelled as retail interest in these companies has been extremely inadequate. Meaning there must have been intense back channeling and kickbacks to fund managers to invest in these kind of IPOs.

3) AMCs have a fiduciary responsibility above all else. They can make any bids and take any risk as long as it is in concurrence with SEBI guidelines but when it is such a clear case of a poor company, the AMCs have literally, resorted to gambling, if not bribery. If their due diligence was so poor that they invested in such companies with poor financials, it raises serious doubts about the integrity and trust on the fund houses. 

4) Mutual Funds Sahi Hai? They handle such large amounts of assets that someone is bound to get greedy. With disclosures only mandated to monthly frequency, whatever they do with the money in the meantime is a black box, nobody knows.

5) As a corollary to my previous point, the huge amounts of assets under management with Mutual Funds, it makes it harder for their mistakes to come to the fore. But remember it's the compounding of small mistakes that brings down the house of cards, similar to what happened in 2008 crash.

6) IPOs are all about risk management and never about money for AMCs. Mutual Funds have a responsibility of safeguarding their client's money above all else. By taking on such risks they are just skirting on the edge of laws. Nobody can legally challenge their acquisition of IPO because it is well within the law but all these points about conflict of interest, rigging the game, fiduciary responsibility, transparency and ethics, assume a higher meaning when you become the backbone of our country's financial stability. 

Someone needed to drop this truth bomb and I hope investors of these AMCs, question these fund houses on their decision to bid in these poor IPOs. For such smart people that we Indians are, it comes as a shock to me how ignorant people can be when it comes to eliciting answers from faceless organisations. Nobody questions AMCs on their practices and their bad decisions.",1760111919.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1o34vly/ipo_debacle_and_lessons_learnt_from_it/

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"BAJAJ Housing Finance IPO, This is what you need to do after Listing.  BAJAJ Housing Finance Valuation Check

1. At IPO price, market cap will be at Rs. 58k Cr. IPO is valued at P/Bx of 3.2x
2. Other large size peers like LIC Housing, PNB Housing, Canfin Housing are available at P/B 1.3-2.7x.
3. Smaller players like Aadhar, Aavas, Aptus and Home Finance are available at range of 3.3x to 4.8x.
4. Last 3 years growth - AUM growth of 31% CAGR over FY22-24 with 56% PAT CAGR
5. BHFL has lowest GNPA & NNPA in the industry (best asset quality)

So, considering all parameters - its presence in housing finance & other financing space, its superior growth, and best operational metrics along with Top class proven Promoters - BHFL will attract Premium Valuations.

Listing Price View - As per current GMP  it is likely to List around 100% Gains i.e., Rs. 140-150 range vs issue price of Rs. 70/-.

With such listing, it will be available at P/B of above 6x. Leaves limited upside growth.

Sell on Listing - Price above Rs. 130-140

Hold on Listing - Incase of bad listing with 30-60%.

Fresh Buying - Only below Rs. 100-110 range or else I will wait for market to settle down & wait for price discovery because after a good listing gains, hardly any immediate upside is left.

Even though it's a good company, no point in FOMO. Rather I will now focus on other Housing finance company to see if any re-rating possible in other players.

Note: these are not my views but I follow a SEBI registered expert he shared this. Hope it helps the people who got Bajaj Housing finance IPO allotment. ",1726419292.0,483,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fhh85g/bajaj_housing_finance_ipo_this_is_what_you_need/
Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Hyundai IPO is filled with red flags A lot of you are excited about the biggest IPO in India till date. Biggest IPO also means higher chances of allotment.

But is that all?

This IPO has a lot of red flags that cannot be ignored.

First red flag is that issue is 0% fresh issue and 100% offer for sale.

Means that none of the IPO money goes to the Indian arm of the company. 

Yes, you read it right. The money goes to the South Korean promoters which effectively means that promoters are reducing their holdings. Or they want to mint money from the IPO frenzy in India.

This brings us to the second red flag. After the issue, the shareholding changes from 100% promoter holding to 82.5% promoter holding. But wait that's not it. 

According to the amendment to the Securities Contracts Regulation Rules by SEBI in 2010, promoters of listed Indian companies (other than PSU companies) holding more than 75% had to compulsorily sell their additional holdings to bring it down to maximum 75%.

This means that, 7.5% more promoter holding has to be reduced within 3 years of listing. What does this bring us to?

A 7.5% OFS in the next 3 years which might cause the share price to drop even more

Third red flag is the low cash reserves in the company and even worse, increase in dividend payout to the parent company by taking money out of cash reserves. AFTER THE IPO! Wait what!? So this also means we cannot expect the company to issue a fair amount of dividends!

Fourth red flag is that the grey market premium (GMP) is tanking badly and is at a miniscule Rs. 65/share. Remember that the share price will fall further due to selling that happens after the listing.

Some positives are low debt, the car sales number in India and their market share but valuation is equally important if not more. 

Which is why it would be wise to wait for the right valuation to enter for the long-term.",1728939683.0,385,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g3qobl/hyundai_ipo_is_filled_with_red_flags/

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**  
  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  


**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.

**Points to consider**  
  
  
Top 5 states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telengana, Gujarat, Delhi constitute 85% of AUM, any adverse calamity in these states would negatively affect the company.  
  
Large exposure in residential and commercial real estate hence any downturn in this sector might affect Bajaj housing finance negatively.  
  
As it is non-deposit taking NBFCs, it relies on borrowings and hence any impact on interest rate might affect them negatively. 44% of borrowings are at fixed interest rates, 56% of borrowings at floating interest rates whereas 99.8% of loans advanced are in floating interest rates.  
  
Their key business strengths lie in strong parentage , diversified funding sources , vast network and risk management (one of the best HFC’s in capital & profitability ratios).  
  
Bajaj finance holds 100% of BHFL, wherein just 1 year before RHP filing they invested approx Rs 2,000 cr as an equity by acquiring 110,74,19,709 shares at Rs 18.1  
  
Average ticket size being 46 lakhs, BHFL caters to premium housing customers, which is growing at 13-15% CAGR. Also it is easy to lend being high ticket vs Affordable housing finance cos with 10 lakh ticket size.  
  
BHFL has grown at stellar speed, just in 8 years AUM of 97000cr, last 2 year AUM CAGR of 31% and PAT CAGR of 56%- all because of huge customer database of Bajaj Finance. It is said data is the most important moat for Bajaj Finance.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"NTPC Green Energy IPO analysis and verdict **1. Company fundamentals**

NTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:

**Strong Parentage:** Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.

**Company Growth:** NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from ₹910.42 crore in FY 2022 to ₹1,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from ₹94.74 crore in FY 2022 to ₹344.72 crore in FY 2024.

**Government Support:** The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.

2. **Issue size and split**

The size of the IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.

The NTPC Green Energy IPO is a **purely fresh issue**, meaning there is **no Offer For Sale (OFS)** component. This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.

3. **Brand name and experienced Management**

As mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.

The management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.

4. **Valuation**

NTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.

The company's PE ratio of 148 is higher than its smaller peers but is lesser than its bigger rival Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 260. The valuation is considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.

5. **Clear Use of Proceeds**

The company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.

While this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).

6. **Strong underwriting team**

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

The book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.

7. **QIB subscription**

When the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.

**Verdict**

This IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.",1731744514.0,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gsiqni/ntpc_green_energy_ipo_analysis_and_verdict/

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Before you jump into Tata Capital IPO. Please read this. The Tata Capital IPO is set to launch on October 6, 2025, and will close on October 8, 2025. The listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) is scheduled for October 13, 2025. This ₹15,511.87 crore issue includes a fresh issue of ₹6,846 crore and an offer for sale of ₹8,665.87 crore. The price band has been set between ₹310 and ₹326 per share, with a minimum lot size of 46 shares, translating to an investment of approximately ₹14,996 for retail investors. 


ANALYSIS
The Tata brand is strong, but here’s a closer look at the numbers:

•Profits: FY23 showed a high profit (~₹7,000cr), largely from a one-time gain. Core earnings come from interest on loans and fees, which are sensitive to RBI rate changes.

•Debt profile: Borrowings are significant. The housing finance subsidiary (TCHFL) has around 7% non-performing loans, compared with 1.9% overall.

•Cash flow: Free cash flow from core operations is modest. Provisions for bad loans fluctuate year-on-year, reflecting the nature of lending business.

•Key ratios: Capital adequacy is 16.9% (vs peers like Bajaj Finance at 21.9%). Provision coverage ratio has decreased from 74% → 58%. Return on equity was boosted by the one-time gain.

•Valuation: This is the company’s first IPO, so no prior stock performance. Employee stock options are high, which could dilute future shareholder value. Some assets use Level 3 valuation models, which are less transparent.

•Legal & tax matters: Tata Capital and its 
subsidiaries are involved in ~12,000 ongoing cases, including tax disputes worth ~₹5,600cr, consumer complaints, and borrower-related matters.

•Governance: The board largely consists of Tata insiders. There are risk committees, though subsidiaries continue to carry higher exposures.

Final take- Tata Capital combines a trusted brand and scale with certain financial and operational risks. Understanding the debt structure, subsidiary performance, and ongoing legal matters can help potential investors make an informed decision.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Urban Company IPO: Beyond the Grey Market Buzz — A Bottom-up Analysis Urban Company’s IPO is drawing a lot of attention, and for good reason. Here’s a structured look at the issue for investors who want to go beyond the headlines.

**IPO Snapshot**

* Issue size: ₹1,900 crore
* Fresh issue: \~₹472 crore
* Offer for Sale (OFS): \~₹1,428 crore
* Price band: ₹98 – ₹103
* Bidding window: September 10–12, 2025
* Lot size: 145 shares (≈₹14,935 at the upper band for retail)

**Financials**  
FY25 was a turning point. The company posted a net profit of \~₹239.8 crore against losses in prior years, with revenue up by \~38%. The profit was aided by one-time tax credits, but it also reflects improved operating leverage and better unit economics.

**Grey Market Premium (GMP)**  
The GMP has moved up from ₹10 to around ₹28–30 per share, implying potential listing gains of 27–30%. While this signals strong demand, it also sharpens questions about whether valuations are running ahead of fundamentals.

**Why This IPO Matters**

* One of the few tech-enabled services IPOs in 2025, testing investor appetite for the gig-economy model.
* Asset-light business spanning home services, product sales, and international markets (UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia).
* Proceeds earmarked for technology upgrades, cloud infrastructure, office expansion, and marketing — geared toward growth rather than balance sheet repair.

**Key Risks**

* Sustainability of FY25 profitability remains to be proven.
* High competition, aggressive customer acquisition spends, reliance on gig workers, and potential regulatory headwinds.
* Heavy OFS component — a large portion of the issue involves existing shareholders exiting, which could influence supply dynamics post-listing.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Ather IPO is fully SUBSCRIBED! It's like a half-baked factory wants a full-course ₹2,626 Crore funding meal! Here's my take 👇🏻 About Ather: They design their own products like motors, chassis, controllers, chargers, and so on. But outsource manufacturing. Ather has a shiny factory in Hosur (4.2L units/year) and is dreaming of Factory 3.0 to hit 14.2L capacity, but is currently using only 41% of what it already has!

Big Question: Why expand when you're not even close to full capacity?

Ather's ""ask""

1. IPO Price: ₹304–321
2. Fresh issue: ₹2,626 Crore
3. Market Cap post-IPO: ₹11,954 Crore

But here’s the thing, this capex plan? It makes no sense! Why? Well, the financials say LOSSES!

1. Negative cash flow? Yup.
2. Profits? Nowhere in sight. Needs to raise cash again and again, like that friend who always forgets their wallet.

Next comes competition? Ruthless.

TVS and Bajaj aren’t just older, they’re richer, profitable, and out for blood.  
Ather might have started the EV party, but now it’s struggling to stay on the guest list.

That's a lot of baggage, though, but let’s say:

India sells 1.56 Crore EV 2Ws and Ather gets 10% market share = \~12-13L units/year. That’s ₹25-30,000 Crore in sales, and finally, profits + cash flows? But that’s a big “if”. Bajaj & TVS are already saying, “Not so fast.”

Ather looks great on paper and says all the right thing. But is still figuring itself out.

Swipe right only if you're patient, and you might as well be buying hope and not numbers!

So, we are starting an IPO Analysis Series where we look at upcoming Indian IPOs through a **quantitative lens** — no fluff, just data, valuations, risks, and context.

Our first breakdown is on **EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd.** (incorp 1999), a company in the business of pre-engineered steel buildings and prefabricated structures. They also manufacture EPS (thermocol) blocks, sheets, and packaging products.

# 📌 IPO Details

* **Price Band**: ₹194–204
* **Issue Size**: ₹504 Cr (Fresh ₹300 Cr + OFS ₹204 Cr)
* **Current GMP**: \~₹20
* **Use of Proceeds**: Capex, working capital, debt repayment

# 📊 Financial Highlights

* Revenue CAGR: **31.4%** (highest among peers)
* PAT growth: **57%**
* ROE: **22.69%** | ROCE: **22.88%**
* EBITDA Margin: **10%+**

# 🔎 Valuation vs Peers

Peers: PENIND, INTERARCH, EVERESTIND, BEARDSELL

* **P/E** = 34.54 (rich vs peers)
* **ROE** = 22.7% (highest among peers)
* **WC Days** = 35 (very efficient)

# 🧮 Strengths

* Strong presence in a growing prefab construction market
* Diversified product mix (buildings + EPS)
* Expanding capacity with IPO proceeds
* Fastest revenue growth among peers

# ⚓ Anchors & Analyst Views

* Anchor investors include **WhiteOak, 360One, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley**
* Positive recommendations from **Reliance Securities, SBI Securities**

# ⚠️ Risks

* Volatility in raw material prices (steel dependency)
* Execution risks in expansion
* Competition from larger, established players

# 💡 Our Take

At the upper band, valuations look **expensive on P/E basis**, but strong ROE, efficient working capital, and anchor participation show confidence. Might be interesting for listing gains, but medium/long-term depends on execution.

This time, it intends to play big and add significant capacities (6 times in comparison to present capacities), which will take care of growth over the next 3-4 years.  
KRN Heat Exchanger

Through the IPO, which is an entirely fresh issue of shares (raising Rs 342 crore), the company intends to deploy money in a new greenfield facility, having a total capex requirement of about Rs 280 crore. This facility is being developed keeping in mind the requirements of the exports market and emerging new technologies, providing huge scale and competitive advantage.

Having proven its capabilities in the domestic market, the company feels it has huge opportunities in export markets. KRN’s exports have grown from Rs 15 crore in fiscal 2022 to Rs 45 crore in fiscal 2024. They are expected to reach around Rs 80 crore in the current fiscal.

**Balance Sheet**

https://preview.redd.it/5xfsscg5uwqd1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=241fee132b32d96b318c1bfecfc9c15c631e4cc3

**Valuation**

Since the entire proceeds from the IPO will be used to develop new capacities, we value the business based on the core earnings. At the upper price band of Rs 220, the company is looking for a market capitalisation of Rs 1367 crore. However, if we take away the IPO money, cash in the books, and the capital work in progress or the money being deployed in the under-construction facility, it is valued at around Rs 1000 crore which is about 25 times its fiscal 2024 profits — quite reasonable in the light of growth and quality of the business.



# After Analysing RHP of KRN IPO(chatgpt) - OUTLOOK AND RISKS. 

**The company outlook:**

The business outlook for KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Limited, as detailed in their RHP, is positive but relies heavily on the HVAC industry and key customers. 

**Expansion Strategy:**

The company plans to expand its customer base, reducing dependence on its top 10 clients, who account for over 70% of revenue. It has already entered markets across 17 states in India and exports to 9 countries .

The company aims to increase its presence in markets like North America and Europe, as well as solidify its position in the Indian HVAC market .

**Innovation & Cost Efficiency:**

The company benefits from in-house manufacturing processes that allow better quality control and cost advantages compared to competitors who rely on external job work .

By keeping the entire product design, testing, and manufacturing under one roof, they are well-positioned to meet growing demand in a cost-effective manner .

**HVAC Industry Growth:**

The company is highly dependent on the HVAC industry, which is experiencing growth due to the increasing demand for energy-efficient and climate-control systems . However, any downturn in this industry or shifts in technology could adversely affect the company’s future growth .

Overall, the company is positioned for growth, with its strong foothold in the HVAC sector and plans for geographical expansion. However, challenges remain with reliance on key customers and market conditions in the HVAC industry.

  
**The Risk Factors:**

**Revenue Dependency on Key Customers:** 

A significant portion of the company's revenue (approximately 72.31% in FY 2024) comes from its top 10 customers, including Daikin Airconditioning India Private Limited, which alone contributed about 33.34% of revenue. A cancellation or reduction in orders from any of these customers could negatively affect the company​

**Lack of Long-term Contracts with Customers:** 

The company does not have long-term agreements with its customers. If customers decide to switch suppliers or decrease their orders, the company’s financial stability could be compromised​.

**HVAC Industry Dependency:** 

The company's revenue is heavily dependent on the HVAC industry. Any downturn in this industry, whether due to economic conditions, technological changes, or environmental concerns, could adversely affect the company’s growth and profitability​.

**Potential for Production Disruptions:**

The company relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials, and any delay or disruption in the supply chain could negatively impact operations​.

**Lack of Technical Support Agreements :** 

The company does not have formal technical support service agreements in place for machinery maintenance, which could lead to operational disruptions in case of technical breakdowns​.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Should you subscribe to the Anlon Healthcare IPO? RISKS explained!!! Anlon Healthcare, operational since 2017, specializes in manufacturing high-purity pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs. The company operates from a single WHO-GMP and ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Rajkot, Gujarat, with a current production capacity of 400 MTPA, utilized at 84% in FY25. The company's product portfolio has 65 commercialized products, with an additional 28 products in the pilot stage and 49 products under laboratory testing. Notably, Anlon is among the few Indian manufacturers of Loxoprofen Sodium Dihydrate, a specialized API used for pain management in conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and post-surgical recovery.

There are four segments: APIs (40.27% of revenue), Finished Dosage Formulations (53.12%), Nutraceuticals (6.61%), and other segments (0.01%). 

Let's understand the **IPO structure**

The IPO comprises entirely a fresh issue of 1.33 crore equity shares priced between ₹86-91 per share, with a face value of ₹10. The lot size is fixed at 164 shares. 

Now, I will talk about its **financial performance**



||
||
|**Metric** (₹ Crores)|**FY23**|**FY24**|**FY25**|
|Revenue|112.9|66.69|120.46|
|EBITDA|N/A|15.57 |32.38 |
|Net Profit|5.82|9.66|20.52 |



The P/E multiple of 14.3x positions Anlon at a significant discount to peers like AMI Organics (58.5x) and Supriya Lifesciences (29.3x). 

The company has outlined an ambitious expansion strategy centered on capacity enhancement and market diversification. Plans include establishing a new 700 MTPA manufacturing facility within 400 meters of the existing plant, which would increase total capacity to 1,100 MTPA.

**Use of IPO Proceeds** (₹121.03 crores):

1. Capital Expenditure: ₹30.72 crores (25.4%) for facility expansion
2. Working Capital: ₹43.15 crores (35.7%) for operational scaling
3. Debt Repayment: ₹5.00 crores (4.1%) for financial optimization
4. General Corporate Purposes: ₹42.16 crores (34.8%)

The company has filed 21 DMFs across regulated markets including the EU, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Jordan, and Pakistan. Approvals have been secured from ANVISA (Brazil), NMPA (China), and PMDA (Japan) for key products.

**But** Anlon Healthcare faces multiple high-impact risks that potential investors must carefully evaluate.

1. The company's entire manufacturing operation is concentrated in one facility in Rajkot, Gujarat. Any disruption from regulatory issues, natural disasters, or equipment failures could severely impact operations.
2. Approximately 77% of revenue comes from the top 10 customer. Loss of any major customer could significantly impact financial performance.
3.  Despite international regulatory approvals, exports constitute only 3% of total revenue.
4. The company's revenue pattern shows extreme fluctuations, dropping 40.9% in FY24 before surging 80.6% in FY25. So, there are questions about business predictability and sustainability.
5. Top 10 suppliers account for 90% of raw material procurement, creating supply chain vulnerability and potential margin pressure.
6. The API sector faces intense competition from Chinese manufacturers who benefit from cost advantages and scale. China controls approximately two-thirds of India's API imports, creating pricing pressure.
7. The chemical manufacturing sector faces increasing environmental regulations, with potential for production shutdowns due to compliance issues.

The Indian API market presents a robust growth opportunity, valued at $14.18 billion in 2025 and expected to reach $21.46 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 8.54%. India contributes 8.8% of global API production and benefits from the China+1 diversification strategy as global pharmaceutical companies seek alternative suppliers.

**VERDICT**

For Conservative Investors: **AVOID**

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"JSW Cement IPO: A Bet Against the Giants JSW Cement, a part of the JSW Group, opens its IPO on August 7. The ₹3,600 crore issue includes ₹1,600 crore fresh capital, mainly to fund a new Rajasthan plant and repay ₹520 crore of debt. This move could strengthen its presence in North India and improve its cost structure.

But here’s the challenge India’s cement market is dominated by giants like Ultratech and Adani, who enjoy massive scale advantages. JSW Cement is smaller, with 20 MTPA capacity and low utilization (62.9%), meaning growth depends on efficient ramp up of new projects and better distribution.

Will this IPO be a game changer or just a survival move? The big question is whether JSW Cement can break through in a thin margin, hyper competitive industry and deliver post listing growth.",1754478797.0,17,https://i.redd.it/wmsxirwytdhf1.jpeg

Catch the sparkle!  
  
Bengaluru-based BlueStone Jewellery is opening its ₹1,540 crore IPO for subscription from August 11-13, 2025. Price band is set at ₹492-517 per share. The offering includes a fresh issue worth ₹820 crore and an OFS of up to 720 crore shares by major investors like Accel, Kalaari, Saama Capital, IvyCap, and Sunil Kant Munjal.

Key dates & details:

* Subscription: Aug 11-13
* Allotment: Aug 14
* Listing: Aug 19 (BSE, NSE)
* Lot size: 29 shares (\~₹14,993 per lot)
* Total issue size : ₹1,540.65 Cr
* BlueStone is India’s #2 digital-first jewellery brand, with Gaurav Singh Kushwaha as promoter.

BlueStone’s IPO is all over the news, but does the hype stack up?   
  
The company’s got cool tech, its own designs, and a wide reach but let’s face it, this industry is packed with tough competition and keeping up with jewelry trends isn’t easy. Could BlueStone really break through, or will it just be another name lost in the crowd? What’s your gut feeling are you in, or would you stay out?

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"HDB Financial IPO Review, Everything you need to know about The big HDB Financial Services IPO opens for subscription tomorrow! The price band is fixed at  Rs 700 -740 p/sh. The company aims to raise Rs 12,500-cr from the IPO.

For the unaware: the company is HDFC Bank’s NBFC arm. It is India’s 4th largest retail-focused NBFC with Assets under Management (AUM) of Rs 1.07 lakh cr. It operates across three main verticals; MSMEs (39%) asset finance (\~38%) and consumer finance (\~23%). But its secret sauce is its rural customer base. Over 70% of its 1,771 branches are located in Tier-4 or smaller towns, with its average ticket size at Rs 1.65 lakh. Despite the riskier clientele, its asset quality is only slightly higher compared to peers. FYI - the IPO is mostly an Offer for Sale, with the fresh issue of Rs 2,500 cr. The money raised will be used to boost its capital base for regulatory requirements.

**FY25 Snapshot:**

* Net Interest Income: Rs 7,446 cr; +18% YoY
* PAT: Rs 2,176 cr; -12% YoY
* Gross NPA: 2.3% vs 1.9% YoY
* Net NPA: 1% vs 0.6% YoY

Big Picture: There’s a lot of buzz around 2025’s biggest IPO so far. But it’s tough to figure HDB Financial out. It isn’t a specialist like Shriram Finance or Muthoot. It also is a lot smaller than THE diversified giant Bajaj Finance. The key, experts say, is its pipeline to the mostly untapped rural India is why its loan book grew at a CAGR of 23% over FY23-25.

FWIW -  its proposed valuation is a LOT lower than Bajaj Finance and current grey market data suggests it may list at +11% pop. But Bajaj demands a premium for a reason. Does HDB deserve one because of its parent and will it match Bajaj eventually? We’ll have to see.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Kalpataru IPO - Everything you need to know about it **Kalpataru IPO opened for subscription today! The price band is fixed at Rs 387-414 p/sh. The company aims to raise Rs 1,590 cr from the IPO.**

Founded in 1988, the company is part of the Kalpataru Group and is a Mumbai-based real estate developer with a presence in all micromarkets from mid-income to ultra-luxury. It’s the 5th largest player in the Mumbai area and as of December 2024, has completed around 120 projects. Its current pipeline includes 31 ongoing and future projects to be launched by FY27. Fun fact: its multi-segment strategy has helped pre-sales soar from Rs 3,201 cr to a reported Rs 4,800 cr in FY25; a +50% jump! That said, the company has reported losses from FY21-FY24 mostly due to high interest payments.

FYI - the IPO is 100% a fresh issue, which is a big positive. The money raised will be used to repay debt and as capex for the redevelopment biz.

**9MFY25 Snapshot:**

* Revenue: Rs 1,625 cr
* EBITDA: Rs 102 cr
* Margin: 6.2%
* PAT: Rs 9 cr

Big Picture: While the numbers aren’t out yet, it looks like FY25 will be its first year of full profitability, which is great news! While the luxury market has cooled off in 2025, over 70% of  Kalpataru’s is in the sub Rs 3-cr segment which has been doing well. Key positive triggers include how its redevelopment foray works out. Kalpataru is spending Rs 400 cr to get into the business, with one of its upcoming projects located in Chembur. PS - the IPO pricing is on the slightly expensive side and current grey market data suggests it may have very low/no listing gains. So if you’re looking to get in, strap in for the long ride!

There’s a bit of a weird understanding around company ownership in India. If you’re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company’s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company’s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a “promoter”, you end up effectively owning \[1\] the company.

There’s quite a bit of confusion and conflict around this understanding. Sometimes the founder and CEO of a company owning 10% doesn’t want to be called the promoter, but is [forced to](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vijay-shekhar-sharma-paytm-directors-face-sebi-show-cause-notices-over-ipo-breaches-12806852.html). Other times an investor who owns 17% [cannot remove](https://www.medianama.com/2021/10/223-explained-zee-invesco-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a promoter holding less than 4%.

Being a promoter is a state of being. You don’t need a large stake. If you’re calling the shots day-to-day, you’re a promoter. It works the other way too. If you don’t control a company just yet, but want to, you better get yourself put down as a promoter. It’s like drawing a superpower from within the soul of the company that gives you the permission and access to decide how it works.

This week, the Burman family, who are the promoters of the Ayurvedic brand Dabur, also [became the promoters](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/burman-family-acquires-control-become-promoters-of-religare-enterprises-125022001226_1.html) of Religare Enterprises, a financial services conglomerate. They were in the market to own about 51% of Religare, but their offer to buy the public’s shares failed miserably. No matter! They still own 25% of its shares, but more importantly, after a long-drawn conflict, they passed the company’s vibe check and managed to call themselves its promoters.

# An offer that you can refuse

Before this week, Religare did not have a promoter. They did, [once upon a time](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/from-singh-brothers-to-burman-brothers-religares-promoter-blues-continue/articleshow/105266662.cms?from=mdr), but for the last seven years they didn’t. This isn’t a problem. There are large companies like ITC and HDFC Bank without a promoter, and all it means is that there is no one shareholder calling the shots on how the company operates. The shareholders with varying levels of ownership have some representation on the board, which then assigns the CEO, and the CEO reports to the board just as a regular employee would. (And when the CEO leaves, their son or nephew doesn’t take over.)

In September 2023, the Burmans owned \~21% of Religare, which they bought over a few years from the open market. They intended to buy 4% more and exceed 25% in total ownership. There’s a SEBI mandate around such high ownership. If you happen to own 25% of a company’s shares, you have to then offer to buy at least 26% of its remaining shares as well. The idea is that this gives *you* the opportunity to own a controlling stake in the company, and also gives people who may not like you the opportunity to sell their stock to you and get out.

If you’re a serious buyer, your offer to the public had better be more than the stock’s market price. We’re talking about a publicly listed company here—people can sell their shares and move on anyway. The only reason they’d sell to you is if you offered them a better-than-market price for their shares.

When the Burman family first announced their intention to run an offer, Religare’s stock price was around ₹270. The Burmans offered ₹235, a good 13% lower.

The Burmans announced the offer one-and-a-half years back, but it actually happened just last week. And [it failed](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/EFAC8052-C655-4C3B-BC69-8B8C5D55B04A-134530.pdf)! They were out to buy ₹2,116 crore of Religare stock. Shareholders agreed to sell only 0.25% of that, about ₹5.4 crore.

That’s what makes the Burman family’s successful takeover a little weird. They made a shitty offer, it didn’t go through, and yet they control Religare? Tell me if being a promoter isn’t a state of being.

# She does not give up

There are two things I want to mention about Rashmi Saluja, one of them totally irrelevant to this story.

1. Until last week, she was the executive chairperson of Religare.
2. She was [deboarded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-kicks-out-troublesome-head-of-a-top-financial-company-as-she-was-rude/articleshow/108285668.cms?from=mdr) from an Air India flight for being rude to the crew.

Saluja had been the chairperson since [December 2019](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/a7a2e5c3-6e03-4b41-998b-bd6ad741896a.pdf) (the deboarding happened last year) at a time when Religare was almost a dead company because its founders [stole](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-court-frames-criminal-conspiracy-charges-former-religare-enterprises-promoters-loss-firm-9784145/) from the company. I don’t know how Religare turned around, but it did. Saluja had been the chairperson all this while so looks like she did a [good job](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rashmi-saluja-steered-religare-2-0-through-upheaval-changed-firms-fortunes/articleshow/93994326.cms?from=mdr) with it.

https://preview.redd.it/591lou39q1le1.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb9f0ee3177b565cebbbf0de1e53079db0c3c86

Saluja did not want the Burmans to take over Religare. Makes sense to me. If you’re a corporate turnaround artist at a financial services company, you wouldn’t want the company to be taken over by a billionaire family selling [adulterated honey](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/honey-fraud-our-response-to-statements-from-dabur-patanjali-74512). But just how far do you go to keep your job?

Pretty far. Here’s a bit from [earlier this month](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rashmi-saluja-moves-court-again-religare-board-fights-back-3746738/) from the Financial Express:

>The battle for control of Religare Enterprises (REL) has started looking like a never-ending soap opera. On Tuesday, Rashmi Saluja, the ousted executive chairperson of REL, made the first move by filing a fresh writ petition in the Delhi High Court, seeking to quash the open offer by the Burman family-led entities. This marks the seventh legal attempt by her to stall the takeover process. The court is expected to hear her petition on Wednesday (today).

Seventh legal attempt! Saluja does not give up. \[2\]

# Fit and proper!

Religare is a holding company for a brokerage, an insurance company, and an NBFC, among other smaller businesses. For the Burman family to become the promoter, they had to get the approval of the regulator for each line of business. That’s SEBI for being a broker, IRDAI for insurance, and RBI for the NBFC.

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, but someone looking to buy a company like Religare, cannot apply directly to the regulators for approval. Instead, the company itself has to go to its regulators and say “hey this guy’s looking to buy me, are you okay if we let him run an offer for our shareholders to consider?”. The company does have some discretion here. If a potential acquirer isn’t credible, it need not go to the regulators and waste their time. But the Burmans already owned 21% of Religare, obviously had the means to buy more, so Religare didn’t really have any room for discretion.

And yet, Religare’s board, led by Saluja, decided that it did not want to take the Burmans’ offer to the regulators for approval. Apparently the Burmans did not meet the criteria that owners and executives for financial companies must be “fit and proper”.

Fit and proper? That sounds familiar. [We spoke about](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=SEBI%20wanted%20the%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%20which%20is%20just%20a%20bunch%20of%20floor%20criteria%20for%20stuff%20like%20not%20having%20defrauded%20anyone%20or%20being%20a%20criminal.%20Embassy%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20argument%20was%20that%20its%20CEO%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%3F!) these criteria last year when a company argued that their CEO need not be fit and proper. Here Religare is arguing that the potential buyer absolutely must be fit and proper, and that it was deciding that they were not. Surely the Burmans must be in some financial soup? No?

From[ From a Mint report](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bid-to-block-religare-acquisition-burman-family-slams-false-fir-linking-dabur-group-to-mahadev-betting-app-case-11699955913805.html):

>Members of the Dabur group have issued a rebuttal after reports linked its chairman and director to the Mahadev betting app case. The Mumbai Police has reportedly booked 32 people – including Mohit Burman and Gaurav Burman – under various sections of fraud and gambling. A spokesperson for the Burman family however dubbed it a ‘baseless’ accusation that happened to coincide with their bid to acquire Religare Enterprises.

>“We have not received any formal communication on any such FIR. However, we have sighted the FIR which is being circulated to media houses. The FIR is patently false and baseless. Nothing could be further from the truth than as wrongly stated in the FIR,” the spokesperson said.

The Burmans announced that it was going to do an open offer and in a few weeks there were reports that they had an FIR registered against them in an unrelated betting scam. \[3\] Religare used these reports to decide that the Burmans weren’t fit and proper, and wouldn’t even apply for approval to the regulators for good measure.

The Burmans then went to SEBI about this, who eventually forced Religare to actually apply for approval. [This was in June 2024](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2024/interim-order-cum-show-cause-notice-in-the-matter-of-religare-enterprises-limited_84286.html), a good nine months after the Burman family’s initial offer announcement. \[4\]

# Stall, stall, stall

Every year, usually sometime between July and September, every listed company in India holds their annual general meeting. This meeting is when companies are able to get all their important shareholders in one room and have them vote on things that need their approval to go through. Shareholders can also ask the board and executives questions (or share their unsolicited opinions) about the company.

Religare’s annual meeting was scheduled for sometime in September 2024, but the board delayed it to December. From [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/religare-enterprises-agm-delay-shareholders-rashmi-saluja-investors-burman-family-dabur-11724591594022.html):

>Three institutional shareholders said they were unhappy with the decision to postpone the AGM, especially since the company has given no explanation. The delay becomes crucial as chairperson Rashmi Saluja was up for reappointment at this AGM, initially scheduled for September.

>\[…\]

>Saluja is the only non-independent director on the Religare board and, therefore, comes up for retirement at each AGM. The vote to reappoint her will now take place in December after the company secured approval to defer the AGM by three months.

Saluja needed to win the shareholder vote to be reappointed as the chairperson of Religare. This vote is usually a formality, shareholders like to go for whoever’s being presented. Saluja probably didn’t want to risk it, so the meeting was pushed.

Then in December, some random guy filed a public interest litigation (?) in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur—a city that Religare has absolutely nothing to do with—and the court [asked to](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/madhya-pradesh-hc-stays-religare-enterprises-agm-in-response-to-pil/119722) wait on the meeting scheduled for 31 December (which by itself is a weird day to hold a meeting). In January, the court [finally allowed](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/madhya-pradesh-high-court-dismisses-pil-religare-agm-rashmi-saluja-125010900673_1.html) the meeting to proceed because it figured that the litigation was BS.

The meeting was then scheduled again for February, and this was challenged in court again! This time by Saluja herself in the Delhi High Court. The court [refused](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/delhi-hc-rejects-rashmi-saluja-s-plea-to-halt-religare-enterprises-agm-125020601716_1.html) to halt the meeting.

On 7 February, the meeting finally took place and [here’s what happened](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-suspense-at-agm-over-reappointment-of-saluja-3741671/):

>The annual general meeting (AGM) of Religare Enterprises on Friday took an interesting turn after chairperson Rashmi Saluja stopped the discussion on her reappointment (agenda 2), stating that she was not liable to retire by rotation, said sources.

>“So, we can ignore resolution number 2,” she said. When an independent director present at the meeting contested her decision, she dismissed the intervention, saying that his remarks should be taken on record.

Saluja still doesn’t give up! In the meeting, she told everyone that she wasn’t due to retire, and so there was no need for everyone to vote on her reappointment. How thoughtful of her to save everyone’s time.

Of course, that wasn’t the end of it. In the physical meeting, she managed to stop people from voting against her by making sure the vote itself didn’t happen. But voting was held online for shareholders who weren’t at the meeting and two days later [97%](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-over-97-religare-shareholders-reject-salujas-reappointment-3744393/) of Religare’s shareholders had voted against her reappointment. She was *finally* removed from her position as executive chairperson.

# It’s a state of being

Back to the Burmans. They wanted to become the promoters of Religare and decide how it should operate. Initially, Religare’s board of directors were against this and resisted to the extent that they could. Later it was just Saluja who remained obstinate to the extent of not even letting the Burmans’ offer reach the shareholders.

Becoming the promoter isn’t just about owning a large stake. Sure, yes, more shares don’t hurt. And beyond 51% there’s not a lot anyone else can do. But with Saluja no longer a board member, there was no one to stop the Burman family from becoming a promoter. So they became the promoter! Like I said, being a promoter is a state of being.

If Saluja hadn’t been booted out, whoever knows what would’ve happened? With the Burmans’ offer practically rejected by shareholders, there is no way she would’ve let Religare name them as the promoters. Eventually, sure, the Burmans would have succeeded. But that would cost time, legal fees, and maybe a lot more money for yet another long-drawn offer.

# Stay out of jail card

Why was Saluja hell bent on halting the Burmans’ offer? Maybe because she paid herself a lot! She held too much sway within the company and figured out a way to earn many multiples more than other executives at the same level. From [the Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/religare-finvest-issued-esops-to-rashmi-saluja-a-day-after-burmans-open-offer/articleshow/106497688.cms?from=mdr):

>\[…\] Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award, documents reviewed by ET reveal.

>The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore. Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.

Highest paid executive in *Indian corporate history*! \[5\] Most of Saluja’s compensation came from the employee stock options pool of Religare’s subsidiaries, worth anywhere between ₹630 crore to ₹740 crore ($73m to $86m). Her stake was so high that it would represent 8% of Religare’s NBFC! The stock option pool is usually between 5–10%, meant to serve as an incentive for *all* employees to work to get the stock price up and stick around for longer. Saluja hogged the entire thing.

Okay, fighting to stay around as the highest paid executive in Indian corporate history would be alluring. But come on, the annual general meeting was seven days away, and she sued the company she was the chairperson at! And asked shareholders to casually ignore something they were to vote on! That’s extreme.

The Burman family have been [demanding](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/burman-family-demands-sebi-investigation-in-allotment-of-8-esops-shares-to-rfl-chairman-rashmi-saluja-11704286617650.html) an investigation into Saluja’s compensation. If the numbers are true, and they seem to be, Saluja has almost certainly been defrauding the company and its investors. With the Burmans running the company, I wouldn’t be surprised if any documentation around her compensation reached the investigator as a neatly formatted PDF of evidence. That makes her extreme behaviour make a [little bit more](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ed-summons-religare-chairperson-rashmi-saluja-for-questioning/articleshow/116183872.cms?from=mdr) sense.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I use “ownership” for promoters liberally, even though they don’t technically own the company. In everyday conversation I think the distinction doesn’t matter.

\[2\] This better be the name of any biography that happens to be written about Saluja.

\[3\] There’s some [dumb stuff happening](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/remote-controlled-plaint-cops-may-quiz-rashmi-saluja/articleshow/118461248.cms) here that I wouldn’t even be able to scratch the surface of.

\[4\] Religare then challenged SEBI’s ruling in the SAT, which [asked it to comply](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/sat-to-religare-comply-with-sebi-order-apply-for-open-offer-by-july-22/117512). So that was another month wasted.

\[5\] I like how the Economic Times emphasises this, but this may or may not be true! I doubt Saluja would keep getting those stock options every year for life. So not entirely accurate to count it as part of her regular compensation.",1740384990.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1iwx5y9/after_a_yearandhalf_of_conflict_the_burmans/
Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Stallion India Fluorochemicals IPO 1. Company fundamentals

Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited, established in 2002, specializes in the sale of refrigerant, industrial gases, and other related fluorochemical products.

The company's primary business includes debulking, blending, and processing refrigerant and industrial gases, offering products such as pre-filled cans and small cylinders/containers.

Between FY 22 and FY 24, Stallion India Fluorochemicals reported an average three-year Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of approximately 20% and 26%, respectively. The net profit registered a sharp rise of 51.6% year-on-year (YoY) from ₹9.75 crore in FY 23 to ₹14.78 crore in FY 24.

The company also has multiple manufacturing facilities across India with 4 facilities located in Khalapur (Maharashtra), Ghiloth (Rajasthan), Manesar (Haryana) and Panvel (Maharashtra). 

2. Issue size and split

The size of the IPO is small at Rs. 199.45 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,850 for retail investors.

The IPO has majority fresh issue of 1.79 crore shares aggregating to Rs 160.73 crores and Offer For Sale (OFS) component of 0.43 crore shares aggregating to Rs 38.72 crores.

This is a green flag since we know that the promoters are not offloading too many shares.

3. Brand name and experienced Management

Stallion is a prominent player in the flourochemicals market with 10% market share.

The company has a professional management and experienced leadership of the promoter Mr. Shazad Sheriar Rustomji.

He has a good understanding of supply chain logistics with over 3 decades of experience in the field of refrigerants and specialty chemicals.

4. Valuation

The company is fairly priced with a P/E ratio of 48x, based on FY24 earnings post the equity share issuance.

It is a small cap company with a market cap of around Rs. 714 crore

The  valuation is reasonable, given the company's past growth, future growth prospects, and the profitability of the company.

5. Clear Use of Proceeds

The proceeds from the IPO will be used to support increased working capital needs, fund capital expenditures for its semiconductor and specialty gas debulking and blending facilities in Maharashtra, finance capital expenditures for its refrigerant debulking and blending facility in Andhra Pradesh, and to cover general corporate expenses.

The company will also not receive any proceeds from the OFS, as those will go to the selling promoter after deducting offer-related expenses and applicable taxes.

6. Strong underwriting team

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

Sarthi Capital Advisors is the sole book running leaf manager of the IPO, while Bigshare Services is the registrar for the issue.

7. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

On day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion is undersubscribed with only 0.31x subscription showing lack of institutional buyers.

Anchor investors also showed less interest in the IPO with only six anchor investors in the anchor book namely Saint Capital Fund, Ashika Global Securities, Craft Emerging Market Fund, Mint Focussed Growth Fund, Ashika India Select Fund, and Leading Light Fund.

Verdict:

This IPO is balanced but mixed with both pros and cons, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.

But if you're specific about getting listing gains, it's suggested to watch the GMP till the closing of the IPO and then apply.",1737176683.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i408ce/stallion_india_fluorochemicals_ipo/

Ixigo has a good hold in bus segment , which is still underpenetrated, and has higher take rates and contribution margin.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Laxmi Dental IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Based on the below parameters, the IPO has been reviewed:

**1. Strong Company Fundamentals**

Laxmi Dental is a leading dental healthcare provider in India, offering a range of dental services including dental implants, orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry, and more. The company has a pan-India presence with a network of clinics.

The company's revenue grew by 19.75% from ₹161.63 crore in FY23 to ₹193.56 crore in FY24. Even better is that the profits saw a remarkable turnaround, from ₹4.16 crore loss in FY23 to a profit of ₹25.23 crore in FY24, marking an improvement of 706.49%.

The company has also announced that it has secured ₹314 crore from anchor investors ahead of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹407 - ₹428 per share

**2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors**

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion of Laxmi Dental remains undersubscribed with only 0.44 times subscribed or 0.59 times, according to various sources.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

As of Laxmi Dental, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (MF), ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Kotak MF, Mirae Asset MF, Tata MF, Birla Sunlife Insurance, Max Life Insurance, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, Al Mehwar Commercial Investments and Natixis Investment Managers are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

**3. Issue size and split**

The fresh issue size should preferably not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Laxmi Dental's ₹698.06 Cr worth IPO consists of fresh issuance of 0.32 crore equity shares worth ₹138.00 crores and offer for sale of 1.31 crore shares aggregating to Rs 560.06 crores. The split here is 19% fresh issue and 81% OFS. Less than 50% fresh issue is a mediocre number and doesn't bring much credibility to the IPO.

**4. Brand name and experienced Management**

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

Laxmi Dental's leadership team comprises individuals with extensive experience in the dental industry:

* **Mr. Rajesh Khakhar and Mr. Sameer Merchant:** Founder Mr. Khakhar along with co-founder Mr. Merchant has been instrumental and played a pivotal role in providing advanced orthodontic solutions, contributing significantly to the company's growth and bringing advancements in Digital Dentistry and introducing new technologies.

**5. Attractive Valuation**

At the upper price band company is valuing at a P/E of 94.11x. Also based on FY24 earnings, the P/E ratio rises to 130.87, indicating that the issue is priced aggressively. 

As per the high valuation, the earnings and profits growth also have to grow similarly so that the valuation is justified.

**6. Use of proceeds**

The company plans to utilize ₹138 crore from the fresh issue to support several strategic objectives, including the repayment or prepayment, in full or part, of certain outstanding borrowings by the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Additionally, as per the RHP, funds will be allocated toward capital expenditure requirements, such as the acquisition of new machinery for the company and its subsidiary, Bizdent Devices Private Limited. The rest of the amount will be utilized by the company for general corporate purposes.

**Verdict:**

The IPO is worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736856511.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i14mp2/laxmi_dental_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth_diving_in/

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Thoughts on Waaree Energies IPO? If I get the allotment, I plan to invest a lot of my capital in Waaree Energies IPO. 

Previously, I applied for Premier Energies and I'm at 140% gains.

But now I plan to sell some of Waaree Energies lots during the listing, to get some listing gains.

Need your thoughts on this.

My analysis so far:  
The company plans to utilize the funds raised from the IPO (Fresh Issue) primarily for two purposes:

1. **Establishing a Manufacturing Facility**: The proceeds will partly finance the cost of establishing a 6GW manufacturing facility for ingot wafer, solar cell, and solar PV module production in Odisha, India. The estimated amount allocated for this purpose from the net proceeds is ₹25,000 million.
2. **General Corporate Purposes**: A portion of the funds will be allocated to general corporate purposes, although the specific amount will be finalized based on the offer price.

The company plans to use approximately 83.3% of the net proceeds from the IPO to establish the manufacturing facility in Odisha.

The total issue size of Waaree Energies Limited's IPO is up to ₹30,000 million, which includes:

1. **Fresh Issue**: Up to ₹30,000 million, which will be used for funding the manufacturing facility and general corporate purposes.
2. **Offer for Sale (OFS)**: In addition, up to 3,200,000 equity shares will be offered by the selling shareholders, though the exact amount from the OFS isn't specified yet​

Now, comparing the IPO Use of Proceeds between Premier Energies and Waaree Energies:

* **Premier Energies Limited**:
   * **Total Fresh Issue Amount**: ₹15,000 million.
   * **Primary Use**: Establishment of a 4 GW Solar PV TOPCon Cell and 4 GW Solar PV TOPCon Module manufacturing facility in Hyderabad, Telangana.
   * **Percentage Allocation**: The entire net proceeds from the Fresh Issue are planned to be directed towards setting up the manufacturing facility and general corporate purposes. Of the total amount, approximately 77.9% (₹11,687.38 million out of ₹15,000 million) will be used to part-finance the facility​.
* **Waaree Energies Limited**:

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Swiggy IPO in the first week of November  Swiggy is coming up with its IPO in the first week of November. Here is a short summary of the IPO:

• IPO Size: The total size of Swiggy’s IPO, including the offer for sale, is projected to be between INR 11,700 Cr and INR 11,800 Cr.

• Subscription Dates: The IPO will open for public subscription from November 6 and close on November 8, with anchor investor bidding set for November 5.

• Valuation: Swiggy has significantly reduced its valuation target to $11.3 billion, just above its last private valuation of $10.7 billion. This is a sharp decline from the previously anticipated $15 billion target.

• Market Context: The Indian stock market has recently seen a decline, with benchmark indices falling about 8% since reaching all-time highs last month. Competitor Zomato is currently valued at over $26 billion.

• Issue Composition: The IPO will include a fresh issuance of shares worth INR 4,500 Cr, increased from the initial INR 3,750 Cr, alongside an offer for sale of 18.53 million equity shares.

• Financial Performance: Swiggy reported an 8% year-on-year increase in net loss to INR 611 Cr for the June quarter of 2024, while operating revenue grew 35% YoY to INR 3,222.2 Cr.

• New Services: Ahead of the IPO, Swiggy is launching new offerings, including a 10-minute medicine delivery service in Bengaluru, international login for NRIs to order food and groceries in India, and a concierge service for high-end customers.

• It is also pertinent to note that the targeted valuation would be about $2 Bn short of what Swiggy’s investor Invesco last valued the startup at. Earlier this month, Invesco marked up Swiggy’s valuation by 25% to $13.3 Bn.

• Recently, Swiggy also received the nod from its shareholders to increase the fresh issue size to INR 5,000 Cr from the initial INR 3,750 Cr.

This IPO marks a significant moment for Swiggy as it seeks to navigate a challenging market landscape while competing against established players like Zomato. 

What are your thoughts on this IPO? Will you be applying for it?",1730049453.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gdg147/swiggy_ipo_in_the_first_week_of_november/
Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Standard Glass Lining IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are from personal observations. I’m not a SEBI-registered investor, kindly do your research before making investment decisions.

Last minute quick IPO analysis

1. Strong Company Fundamentals

Standard Glass Lining Technology provides a wide range of solutions that cover design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, installation, commissioning, and the establishment of standard operating procedures for pharmaceutical and chemical producers on a turnkey basis.

The company's revenue grew from ₹240.2 crore in FY22 to ₹543.7 crore in FY24, reflecting a CAGR of 50.5%. Similarly, PAT increased from ₹25.1 crore to ₹60.0 crore, with a CAGR of 55%, supported by its strategic partnerships and inorganic acquisitions.

Standard Glass Lining announced that it has secured ₹123 crore from anchor investors in advance of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹133 - ₹140 per share.

2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of the closing day of IPO, QIBs oversubscribed by issue by 4.67 times.

But it's also important to track and make sure that QIBs show early interest in the IPO instead of pitching in the list minute.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

In this case ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), Kotak MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, 3P Investment Managers, Kotak Infinity Fund - Class AC, ITI MF, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amansa Holdings, and Clarus Capital are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

However, a contrary example here is One97 IPO (Paytm), which had interest from several American players such as Vanguard and even Warren Buffet. However, many of them sold major portions of their investments, and Paytm’s share price is now several times lower than the listing price.

3. Issue size and split

It is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Standard Glass Lining Technology's ₹410.05 crore-worth IPO consists of a fresh issuance of equity shares worth ₹210 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to 1.43 crore shares worth Rs. 200.05 crores by its promoters and other selling stakeholders. More than 50% fresh issue is a decent number and brings credibility to the IPO.

4. Brand name and experienced Management

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

SGTL has experienced people in the management such as:

Mr. Nageswara Rao Kandula: Managing Director with over three decades of experience in creating glass-lined products that meet international standards for various chemically aggressive applications.

Mrs. Krishna Veni Kandula: Executive Director contributing to the company's strategic direction and operations.

Mr. Venkata Mohana Rao Katragadda: Executive Director involved in overseeing the company's engineering and manufacturing processes.

5. Attractive Valuation

At the upper price band company is valuing at P/E of 43.01x (against an industry average of 52x), with an EV/EBITDA of 30.08x and market cap of ₹2792 crores.

This reasonable valuation relative to its peers is a huge green flag.

6. Use of proceeds

The company plans to use ₹130 crore from the fresh issue to repay debts and allocate ₹30 crore for investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, S2 Engineering Industry.

Clearly defined use of proceeds is another reason to invest in the IPO.

Verdict: After a long time, we see an IPO that's worth applying. 100% worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736329987.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hwgjv3/standard_glass_lining_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth/

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Swiggy IPO analysis and verdict 1. Company fundamentals:

Similar to its competitor Zomato during its IPO in 2021, Swiggy is also recording net losses year after year. Although the losses are narrowing down with time, Swiggy faces intense competition in business from Zomato which has captured a lot of market share. 

So, Swiggy's path to profitability is filled with challenges, including Zomato catering and leading even in tier-2 and tier-3 districts. Swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its Q-commerce (quick commerce) business to become profitable.

2. Issue size and split

It is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. Swiggy IPO is worth 11,327 crore and about 40% of it is fresh issue shares, which is just about fine to create trust among investors.

3. Brand name and experienced Management

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth. Swiggy is a startup and doesn't have a big conglomerate to propel the business.

However, the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate, adapt to market trends, and execute strategies effectively.

5. Valuation

Swiggy's management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front.

6. Clear Use of Proceeds

The company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the IPO, such as for expansion, R&D, or reducing debt. 

As mentioned earlier Swiggy is looking to grow its Q-commerce business. So a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the IPO – Rs 982 crore – is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of Instamart’s dark store. The remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in Scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same Scootsy segment.

7. Strong underwriting team

Underwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company, scrutinizing its financial statements, business model, management team, and future prospects. This process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities. Therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO can signal credibility and thorough due diligence. 

The book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, JPMorgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Jefferies India, ICICI Securities, and Avendus Capital. Most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy.

But considering the current market sentiments and competition with Zomato, it is almost certain that Swiggy is set to list at a discount. Especially considering that the GMP of the IPO is at Rs. 12 (just a 4% premium).

Verdict: If you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains (although this is far fetched), you can invest according to your risk appetite, keeping in mind that the IPO is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium.",1730817311.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gk83cr/swiggy_ipo_analysis_and_verdict/

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Vikram Solar FY24 Financial Highlights (Unlisted Share)
 * **Revenue Growth:** 20% YoY increase, with product sales up 27%, driven by n-TOPCon technology. Export sales contributed 61.58% of total revenue, while EPC services declined by 58%.
* **Profitability:** Operating Profit Margin (OPM) reached 16%, and Net Profit Margin (NPM) increased to 3.2%. Gross margins improved by 1,000 basis points YoY.
* **Asset & Debt Management:** PPE grew at a 68% CAGR; debt-to-equity ratio at 1.8. Cash conversion cycle extended to 3.6 months.
* **Manufacturing Expansion:** Current capacity at 3.5 GW, targeting 5 GW by FY25 and 10.5 GW by FY26. New facility and advanced technologies in the pipeline.

**IPO & Investment Opportunity:**

* Vikram Solar filed its DRHP with SEBI on September 30, 2024, for an IPO including fresh shares worth ₹1,500 crore and an OFS of up to 17.45 million equity shares by the promoter group. A ₹300 crore pre-IPO placement is also possible.
* The company plans to use ₹793.36 crore for a new 3 GW solar cell and module facility via VSL Green Power, and ₹602.95 crore to expand existing module capacity from 3 GW to 6 GW.
* The order book stands at 8,214.63 MW, with a target of 10.5 GW production capacity by FY26 and 15.5 GW by FY27.
* Vikram Solar has signed a retainer letter with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for $200 million in funding for its Tamil Nadu plant.

The company raised \~₹720 crore through a private placement in Q1 FY25 at a valuation of \~₹3,150 crore and may raise ₹300 crore more before the IPO, making forward EPS difficult to estimate. However, with strong sectoral tailwinds and ongoing capacity expansion, Vikram Solar’s legacy EPS is expected to experience supernormal growth in the near term, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Waaree Energies Ltd Unlisted Shares FY24 Results and Business Update
 **Waaree Energies Ltd, India's largest solar module manufacturer, delivered robust financial and operational results for FY24, marking another year of significant growth and strategic progress.**

The company reported an impressive **68.8% year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenue from operations**, reaching ₹1,13,976.09 million for FY24. This surge in revenue was complemented by a remarkable **154% YoY growth in profit after tax (PAT)**, which soared to ₹12,743.77 million. Waaree’s expansion into various verticals of the solar energy business, along with its strategic focus on exports, contributed significantly to these results.

Waaree Energies has maintained a strong foothold in the market with its **12 GW solar module manufacturing capacity**, which positions it as a leader in India's renewable energy sector. During FY24, the company executed **704 MWp of EPC projects** and managed a portfolio of **over 500 MWp in operations and maintenance (O&M)** services, further highlighting its execution capabilities.

The company’s order book stood strong at **19,928.12 MW** as of March 31, 2024, demonstrating its ability to attract substantial contracts. Moreover, Waaree is focusing on expanding its capacity, aiming to establish **21 GW of solar cell capacity** and **11.4 GW of ingot-wafer capacity** by FY26-27. This includes the commissioning of a **6 GW fully integrated facility** for the production of ingots, wafers, solar cells, and modules in Odisha, along with 1.6 GW of capacity in the United States, solidifying its global expansion ambitions.

# Business Strategy and Growth

Waaree’s strategy revolves around capacity expansion, operational excellence, and international growth. The company’s plans to commission **5.4 GW of additional solar cell capacity by FY24-25** are a critical component of its roadmap for growth. Waaree’s ongoing efforts to increase its U.S. manufacturing presence, with a **3 GW facility under development**, showcase its strategic intent to tap into global markets, especially in regions like the U.S. where solar demand is rising.

Export sales, particularly to the U.S., have become a dominant revenue stream for the company. In the first quarter of FY24 alone, exports accounted for **73% of total revenue**, with the U.S. contributing a substantial **65%** of the company’s revenues. Waaree's increasing reliance on international markets does pose potential risks, particularly with regard to fluctuating demand and policy changes in the U.S. However, the company’s leadership in innovation, cost-efficiency, and capacity expansion across markets positions it well to mitigate these risks.

**Retail sales**, although a smaller part of Waaree’s overall business (contributing **9.96% to total revenue in FY23**), continue to grow, supported by programs like the **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana**. However, this vertical is largely concentrated in Gujarat, and any adverse demand fluctuations from this region could impact Waaree’s business.

# IPO Update: A Key Milestone

Waaree Energies Ltd is gearing up for its **initial public offering (IPO)**, which is expected to launch in **mid-October 2024**, according to recent updates. The IPO is projected to raise **₹3,000 crore** through a combination of fresh equity and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to **32 lakh shares**. The company received regulatory approval for its IPO on September 20, 2024, and has outlined its plans to use the proceeds for capacity expansion and general corporate purposes.

A significant portion of the funds raised will be utilized to establish a **6 GW ingot-wafer, solar cell, and module manufacturing facility in Odisha**, further bolstering Waaree’s production capacity. The OFS includes shares from promoter entities such as **Waaree Sustainable Finance Private Limited** and **Chandurkar Investments**, as well as shares from individual shareholders like **Samir Surendra Shah**.

The company's **aggregate installed capacity of 12 GW** as of June 2023, and its strategic focus on the U.S. market and retail expansion, provide a compelling investment thesis for potential investors. Additionally, Waaree’s financial performance, with **revenues more than doubling from FY22 to FY23** (from ₹2,854 crore to ₹6,750 crore), and a **nearly five-fold increase in PAT**, showcases the company’s growth trajectory and financial resilience.

# Challenges and Risks

Despite its impressive financial performance, Waaree faces several challenges. The company’s **heavy reliance on the U.S. market** for revenue presents risks associated with geopolitical and trade uncertainties. In FY24, **76.11% of its revenue came from just 10 customers**, with its largest customer contributing 20% of total revenue, signaling high customer concentration risk.

Additionally, Waaree’s expansion into retail, particularly in Gujarat, exposes it to regional demand fluctuations. Moreover, the company’s ability to execute its U.S. capacity expansion will be crucial in determining its future growth trajectory, and any delays or inefficiencies could impact its financial performance.

# Conclusion

Waaree Energies Ltd has delivered an outstanding performance in FY24, marked by substantial revenue and profit growth, a robust order book, and ongoing expansion in manufacturing capacity. With its IPO set for mid-October 2024, the company is poised to scale new heights, driven by strategic investments in both domestic and international markets. However, navigating risks such as export dependency and customer concentration will be critical to sustaining its growth momentum in the years ahead.  
  
As of FY24, Waaree's **EPS stands at ₹48.05 per share**, implying that the company's shares are trading at a **fair value of \~60 P/E** presenting a lucrative investment opportunity.

Thinking Hats Entertainment Solutions, which has a price band set between ₹42 and ₹44 per share, totaling an issue size of 34,29,000 shares. For retail investors like me, the minimum investment required is ₹1,32,000 for 3,000 shares. I’ve noticed substantial interest in this IPO, as it has already been subscribed 48.36 times overall, with an impressive 64.53 times in the retail segment. Given this high demand, I expect the stock to list above ₹44 on October 3, 2024. If it lists at ₹50, I could realize a gain of ₹18,000; at ₹52, my gain might increase to ₹24,000; and if it reaches ₹55, I could potentially earn as much as ₹33,000. 

the only thing ticking me is 15 crore fresh issue 

the amount seems very small compared to its potential market 

ott platforms and movie industry is capex oriented market and we never know what can be downturn

let me know if u r applying and if get alloted will u exit for listing gains or longterm?",1727344551.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fpsi27/thinking_hats_entertainment_solutions_ipo_what/
Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"🚀 How Are Markets Meeting Record Mutual Fund Inflows? 🚀 With Indian mutual funds experiencing record inflows recently, it's natural to wonder how such increased demand is being managed. Here’s a breakdown of how the market adapts:

1️⃣ SIP Figures vs. Reality: The reported SIP numbers can sometimes be inflated, as many SIPs may not be as consistent as publicized. The net SIP inflows are often lower than the reported figures. 📊

2️⃣ Creating New Supply: To meet increased demand, the market creates new supply. This comes in the form of:

✦ IPOs: Fresh listings, like that quirky showroom company (😉), help inject new shares into the market.

✦ Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs): Companies issue additional shares to institutional investors.

✦ Stake Reductions: Promoters may reduce their stakes, providing more shares to the market. 🏢

3️⃣ Portfolio Rebalancing: Existing investors may sell some holdings to rebalance their portfolios, releasing additional shares that new investors can purchase. 🔄📈

Key Takeaway: The market is dynamic and adjusts to increased demand through various mechanisms. Don’t underestimate its ability to adapt—India, being a relatively young market, will continue to evolve and manage demand as seen in more mature markets globally.

Happy investing and stay informed! 💼📉",1725190892.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1f6cfqu/how_are_markets_meeting_record_mutual_fund_inflows/

**Lightweighting is becoming all the more relevant (as EVs are emerging)for  improving range for the given battery capacity. Light weighting can be achieved by using aluminium alloy as it is significantly lighter than ferrous alloys.  Also, due to increase in electronic controls in vehicles, aluminium alloy content is increasing continuously due to heat dissipation properties**.  
Applications of aluminium in EVs include lightweight battery casings, motor housings and heat exchangers, besides overall structural integration.

&#x200B;

**Long standing relationships with top clients ( > 20 years with Hero, Honda , Bajaj, TVS) is a MOAT, which is strengthened by the CRITICALITY factor. Brake systems being critical safety component( any errors has direct forbearance with reputation of OEM) undergoes through stringent approval & validation cycle-** a natural entry barrier for OE suppliers.

Revenues tied to 2 wheelers ( 74% of revenues) , so dependent mostly on this industry

80% of revenues contributed by Brake Systems, ALP systems - which are EV agnostic- unaffected migration from IC engines to EV.

Margins dependent on raw material fluctuations ( mainly Aluminium) - which affected in  last 2 years.

R & D cost only 0.03% of revenues- quite low for auto ancilliary working in critical parts

Future growth will come from ALP systems- with more lightweighting and EV conversion

 Main competitors are Adani Total Gas, Indraprastha Gas, Mahanagar Gas, Gujarat Gas

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Industry overview**  


Natural gas demand is 164 MMSCMD in FY23( domestic production 92, LNG imports 72), which has not increased much since last 7 years.  
The fertilizer (33%), CGD and power sectors contributes 67% of the total gas consumption  


**Demand drivers in CGD**    
1. expanding geographical coverage   
2. improving cost competitiveness of gas   
3. Assured domestic gas supply   
4.  Regulatory restrictions   
5. Growing awareness of cleaner fuel 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Operating metrics**  
 

Revenue mix  


PNG  57% ( was 24% in FY21)  
CNG 42%  
CNG mix is quite higher ( >60%) in case of competitors Adani, Indraprastha, Mahanagar.  


Revenue mix- PNG ( based on customer type)/ No of customers  


Industrial          54%  / 186  
Commercial  0.52%  / 125  
Domestic       2.35% /  48177 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

**Financials**  


Annual revenues of IRM Energy is 1040cr.  PAT  60cr.   
Revenues became 5X in last 2 years, PAT > 2X in 2 years.

  
PAT not increased proportionately owing to abnormal natural gas prices last year - H1 FY23, due to Ukraine-Russia war

**Margins of all players drastically reduced in FY23 due to sharp spike in gas prices.**  


EBITDA margins 12% (peers at 20%, comparable Gujarat Gas 15%)  
PAT margins 6.1% ( peers 12%, comparable Gujarat Gas 9.1% )  
ROCE at 18% ( peers > 23%)

 Debt/ equity ratio at 0.87 

&#x200B;

 

**Points to consider**  


1. **Sharp fluctuations in natural gas prices** can severely dent the margins of gas distribution players like IRM Energy, similar to what happened in FY23.  (Russia- Ukraine war)  


2. Govt push to shift to cleaner fuels coupled with initiatives of companies to CNG conversion will aid usage of CNG in commercial vehicles. **But cost competitiveness of CNG as auto-fuel in private cars** ( assuming mostly sedans are sold) **are not very significant** for most users ( 1000km/ month usage) who user cars occasionally on weekends.  


3. **CGD sector is seeing huge investments of 1.2 lakh crores in coming years** owing to increased urbanization and further improvement in penetration. Adani Total Gas alone has announced Rs 20000cr investment by 2030 in CGD. Further investments of these companies are in EV charging stations, biofuels.  


4. **IRM Energy has invested in bio fuels, waste management, EV charging infra.** Though other bigger peers are diversifying in bio fuels, waste management, EV charging stations- one has to look into closely whether bio fuels, waste management investment at this stage also by IRM Energy is running on debt and still small in size compared to peers without using that capital to grow core business will be beneficial or not.

&#x200B;

 

**Points to consider**  


1. While Mamaearth has positioned itself as digital first brand, **dependence of e-commerce marketplaces  (34% of sales) can affect margins** in case marketplace decides to increase commissions.   


2.Though placing themselves as digital first brand, **metrics of their website ( customer visits/ average spends/ user) are yet to to disclosed. Neither any plans to increase DTC sales disclosed in RHP.**   


3.FMCG being a distribution led model, strong offline presence is important for a brand to attain significant scale and sustain against established giants in the long run.    


4.Bulk of Sales comes from Mamaearth brand ( 79%),ad spends 31% of sales for Mamaearth. **But ad spends on rest 5 brands is 162cr ( 62% of sales).  And still they mentioned they will keep adding brands, acquiring new brands. Points to  capital allocation priorities of company.**  


5.New SKUs launched in FY23 contributed 57% of sales- **which puts a question on the traction of earlier vintage SKUs amongst customer mindspace**. If vintage products are not generating repeat sales, leads to a cause of concern.  


6.Giants like Marico also entering digital first space through acquisitions, own brands- so competition from established players has to be considered.  


7.Fresh issue being only 365cr ( ad spend of FY23 was 530cr, cash balance is 4cr), will not serve any significant purpose for growth of the company

&#x200B;

  


**Valuation**  


Mamaearth is valued at Price/ Sales of 7 . Nykaa trades at similar valuation of P/S of 8 ( PAT of 20cr), though Nykaa has achieved a scale of 4000cr in BPC, and has significant traction in its own website and much deeper content marketing/ influencer marketing presence.

&#x200B;

**Points to consider**

&#x200B;

1.Despite challenges in US, EU, automotive R&D upgrade being need of the hour for auto OEMs, ER&D spends unlikely to be postponed by companies, given the timelines of carbon neutrality achievement and EV competition from Tesla.

2.Automotive ER&D industry is in sweet spot for coming times, and along with KPIT Tech, Tata Technologies is favourably placed to benefit from the tailwinds. Separate listing may help it scale newer heights.

**3.Continuous supply of large number of low cost engineering talent is the main moat of of Indian ER&D companies. Considering the attrition of 20% , fresh supply pipeline of 2500 graduates is in place thanks to Education course business and tie-ups with colleges**.

**4.Very high client concentration, given 40% of revenues from Tata Motors/JLR, growth significantly dependent on orders of Tata. Top 5 clients giving 73% of revenues is way too high.**

5. Receivables 25% of revenues (higher than peers) and cashflow from operations < PAT ( where peers> 100% of PAT) is something to be noted, FY22 was negative cashflow, though business being B2B, cashflows are bound to be lumpy.

6. 26% of revenues depend on new energy startups.

7.Margins dependent on forex fluctuations.

8.    26% of revenues depend on new energy startups.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

**Points to consider**  


Saree market in south is largest- 50% of organized saree market of India is in South. Being among the largest players alongside Pothys with 10% market share, and increasing store count from 54 to 84 in next 3 years will help Sai Silks to sustain this leadership.    


**Threat from national apparel retail chains is not there as they focus on western wear and SKD segment of Indian wear, as saree retail is higher inventory business, keeping huge SKUs at that scale they operate may not be efficient capital allocation for them.**  


Saree business is inventory heavy , though fund raised in IPO should suffice for next 2 years requirements including additional stores opened.  


&#x200B;

**Valuation**  


Sai Silks is valued at P/E of 35, whereas Trent trades at 110-150, Shoppers Stop 70, Aditya Birla Fashions is loss making.

&#x200B;

 

**Points to consider**  


10% share of organized jewellery market is significant,considering 4 other prominent players are present in those states including leader Titan. But bigger players Titan and Kalyan are expanding network very fast with access to much higher capital base. Along with that, Joylukkas and Malabar gold also have significant presence in Andhra. So significant competition is there, and jewellery business favours larger organized players as lot of capital is required to expand fast in jewellery owing to huge inventory cost of gold, considering capex is done through franchisee mode.  


**65% of revenues comes from Vizag only, so there is significant dependence on single town.**  


**Revenue/ sqft are more than 2x of even Titan,considering Vizag is not a metro** ( most revenues) which is surprising. Other metrics are comparable to Thangamail and Kalyan.

China produces 55% of global steel output, with India at 3rd position producing 7%, after Indonesia.  
Metal products – manufacturing of kitchen utensils and home ware – is the largest end use of stainless-steel  


**SS Finishing sheet**  
Key segments that are driving the demand for SS sheets are Architecture, Building & Construction (ABC) and Automotive, Railway & Transport (ART). In ABC, the usage is primarily on roofing and cladding and in elevators & escalators .   
ABC sector demand comes from office building construction, organized retail construction and hospitality space.

**Points to consider**  


It needs to be seen if Ratnaveer can  benefit from demand from railway coaches and metro coaches, otherwise other demand drivers of SS finishing sheet ( their main product) are aesthetic and decorative in nature.  


Industry does not have any pricing power, the lowest cost producer wins. Further dependent on steel price fluctuations.

**2nd largest commercial port operator**  
9 Port Concessions ( 7 in India)  


provide cargo handling, logistics services,storage solutions, and other value-added services to our customers  


Ports and port terminals of JSW Infra have long concession periods- **Current weighted average remaining concession period is 25 years.**   
Location of ports are diversified, strategically located closer to JSW Group customers (JSW Steel, JSW Energy), covering vast industrial belt hinterlands.  
.   


**Future plans**  
JSW Infra aims to achieve capacities of 300 MTPA by 2030 ( 158MTPA FY23)  
They will also focus on diversification of cargo mix, increase third party customers business share from 33%  
Main competitors are Adani ports, Gujarav Pipavav, JM Baxi.   


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Industry overview**  


**Port traffic in FY 23 was 783 million tonnes in major ports, 650 million tonnes in non-major ports.** Overseas cargo formed 79% of movement, rest coastal cargo.  
India has 212 non-major ports and 12 major ports.  Ports handle 90% by volume and 70% by value of India’s external trade.  


**Major commodity wise port traffic (FY 23)**  


Coal traffic                   367 MMT  
Crude oil & products   443 MMT  
Iron Ore                         100 MMT  
**Major vs minor ports**  


Non-major ports have lesser congestion levels vs major ports, as major ports have access channel is sharing. The cargo ramp-up possibility at non-major ports is also higher.**Poor operational performance of major ports and aggressive expansion undertaken by non-major ports has resulted in traffic being diverted to non-major ports.**

 **Important observations**  


52% of business comes from **captive customer base** of JSW Energy & JSW Steel. 64% of revenues is from repeat customers. **This is a an important moat, though Adani & GPPL also has this.**  


**Long term leases of operating ports is another moat**. JSW Infra has average 25 years of lease agreement time remaining for ports it operates  
**40% of revenues come from JSW Steel- very high customer concentration,** which may affect the business of JSW Infra in case JSW Steel business suffers.  


Port operations are subject to environmental clearances and scrutiny of National Green Tribunal. Operations may get hampered if it comes under violations of ESG clearances

&#x200B;

**Industry overview**

Infra development is one of the key drivers of a developing economy. In budget 2023, govt. **increased allocation to infra budget by 33% YOY to Rs 10 lakh crore** ( 3x the budget of 2019). Govt. has launched National Infra Pipeline ( NIP) , PLI scheme to boost infra developments. **Financial assistance of Rs1,30,000cr interest free loans for 50 years has been allocated to states for infra push.**  


**Water supply**   
India  is home to 18% of world's population and 4% of fresh water reserves. In  2022, 17% of households are reported to have access to tap water  connections. Govt. has launched **Jal Jeevan Mission** to bridge this gap, with **total project outlay of Rs 3,60,000cr.  FY 24 budgetary allocation is Rs 70000cr.**  


**Waste water treatment** is another scope of work. **72% of waste water is left untreated currently.** Govt is pushing for waste water treatment, agricultural water re-use, industrial water re-use, River Ganga treatment.  


**Rail infra**  
The Government has proposed a **70% YOY increase in budgetary allocation of Rs 2,40,000 to Railways in Budget FY 24.** **Govt is aiming for 45% share of rail in freight transport by 2030 ( current 27%)**,  for that they are initiating different projects under PPP model. Govt.  is looking for 100% electrification of railways and introducing  automation across operations.  


**Roan Infra**  
In **budget FY24, Govt allocated  Rs 2,70,000 towards road construction** ( Rs1,99,000cr in FY23).  


 **Total order book stands at 3880cr**  (July '23) ( Annual Revenues 1170cr)  
77% of order book is from Rajasthan (61%) and UP, so there is geographical concentration of 2 states.  
81% revenues generated from top 5 clients, so there is very high client concentration.  


&#x200B;

**Financials**   


Annual revenues of Vishnu Prakash is 1170cr.  PAT  90cr.  
**67% of revenue came from Rajasthan projects.**  
Revenue from operations increased at CAGR of 55%, PAT increased at CAGR of 118% from FY 21 to FY 23.

**Profits have become 5X in last 2 years.**  
EBITDA margins expanded from 9.7% to13.5% in 2 years. ( peers PNC Infra, HG Infra at 19-21%, NCC , RVNL at 10%)

**Points to consider**  


1. Vishnu Prakash has 36 years of experience in Water supply projects, which is their core area of focus. **(78% of order book)**  


2. Robust order book of 3800cr ( more than 3x of current revenues) is a big plus.  


3.In-house integration model and relations with govt departments through years of project execution is an advantage.  


4.**Geographical concentration in Rajasthan and UP is a risk ( 77% of order book)**. 67% of FY 23 revenues came from Rajasthan projects.  


5. Also there is significant client concentration risk with 81% revenues coming from top 5 clients.  


6. Cashflow  from operations being negative, and business being high working capital  intensive ( which may increase anytime if any big payment is further  delayed), they will need to raise further money for working capital if  revenue has to grown so steeply ( IPO proceeds of 150cr will be utilized  for  this)

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Digit IPO: Go or No Go? *Digit (GoDigit General Insurance Limited), a 5-year old insurtech startup, filed its DRHP a couple of weeks ago. With industry veteran, Kamesh Goyal at the helm and with Prem Watsa's backing, the company has been closely tracked.* 

*Digit has managed to significantly differentiate itself in the motor insurance landscape with its seamless digital offerings. As a result, the company has grown gross premiums by \~50%+ CAGR over the last 3 years and has captured meaningful market share in the motor segment.*

*But - if the last 2 years has taught us anything, it is that startup IPOs (fintech & otherwise) haven't served their investors too well.*

*While we don't know Digit's IPO valuations yet, the company is likely to value itself at a premium to its recent fund raise valuation of \~$4B. Will Digit's IPO be reasonably priced?*

*Won't prescribe an answer, but will rather lay out a framework to think about it. Read on!* 

**Digit & the non-life insurance opportunity**

**Digit - the company**  


Digit was founded in December 2017, and has carved out a leadership position for itself in the general insurance space in a very short period of time. Two reasons we think this happened:  
1. Digit's simplified and largely digital offerings have really worked well with customers, specifically in the motor insurance space. This has positioned Digit really well to tap into India's significantly under penetrated insurance market (more on this later).  
2. Digit has a world class promoter group with deep industry expertise - Kamesh Goyal, the CEO, is an industry veteran with 3+ decades in the insurance space, and Prem Watsa's Fairfax Financial is one of the largest investors in the company. 

**The Non-Life opportunity in India** 

 Let's look at the penetration of non-life insurance in India. To evaluate this, we will look at two metrics -  a) total non-life premium as a % of GDP and b) premium per capita. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ped3p1cyxnl91.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=b79b4eb18436cbbc041ae1ab4d717d583ac60439

 Clearly, penetration in India is awfully low - in fact it is low even when benchmarked to other emerging economies - making non-life a massive untapped opportunity. 

**Digit's position in the Insurance landscape**  


Firstly, Digit has managed to grow really fast. Here is a snapshot of some of the company's key business stats that demonstrates this. 

https://preview.redd.it/g0gm0am8ynl91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=47e7da51541285549d6840b48baa631a32c74002

Second, most of Digit's business and growth has come from Motor (ICICI is the market leader in Motor Insurance). Clearly, the company needs to demonstrate that it can replicate its motor success in other areas. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l931zxaynl91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb42a30e4e5279520ba970cf9996286b16226c0

 **Why is Digit IPO'ing now?**  


Digit is tapping the public markets for two reasons (beyond the indirect benefit of a public listing creating visibility and unlocking valuation for the company).  


**Fresh Issue:** Firstly, Digit is looking to do a fresh issue of shares to raise Rs.1250 crores to capitalize the company and raise its solvency ratio.  
**Offer for Sale:** Secondly, a number of existing investors will sell their shares as part of the IPO. This means the proceeds from this don't make it to the company, but go into the hands of existing share holders. This is fairly common during IPOs. The exact extent of OFS has not been specified and will be known when the company finalizes an exact share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/v73at7nmynl91.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f25e4dcafb7bcab356c51d0a243ac915467f1d6

**Digit's IPO valuation**  


Now that we know why Digit is raising money, let's make an educated guess on the company's potential IPO valuation. Here is what we know about recent valuations:  


1. Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma were issued shares at a valuation of \~$1B in February 2020. (This name dropping adds no value to the story, but we figured we'd share the trivia!)  
2. The company's recent share issuances in May 2022 were at a valuation of \~$3.6B (or \~29K crores). Existing backers including Sequoia infused capital in this round.  


Given the recent fund raise, Digit will likely IPO at a valuation of >29K crores or >$3.6B. While we don't know the exact numbers yet, let's assume this is at least 30-35% higher than its recent valuation, pegging the value at \~$5B.  


But is Digit worth $5B? Let's break this down. 

**Is the Digit IPO worth it?**

To start with, let's look at how Digit performs on various P&L and balance sheet metrics v/s listed peers.  
 

https://preview.redd.it/gp6mi61pznl91.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd454d2036eae7c507aae7aff79f155a0f22f712

https://preview.redd.it/7khwvgzpznl91.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee6f8d9d1b2a124e17d245da1ac9b9b952acb8de

https://preview.redd.it/j80wh8sqznl91.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=333ccdaeaefabb1bdd3eb0410c8698f54d463db3

Here are some points to note:  
1. Digit is unprofitable, but we'll ignore profit for now given the company is growing fast. Given this, we can't do a price to earnings multiple for Digit.  
2. Digit's solvency ratio post the IPO raise would be one of the best in the industry.  
3. In terms of profitability, ICICI Lombard is the best performer - not only in terms of posting a healthy profit but also having a robust return on equity.  


Given this, let's value each of these companies on price to book (P/B) or price to networth (a common metric used for financial services companies). Digit's P/B has been evaluated for its recent pre-IPO raise at $3.6B (labelled Pre-IPO) and an assumed valuation of $5B (labelled Post-IPO). 

https://preview.redd.it/t78c8exwznl91.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c251022bf17c2612cccbf15e240cb4c9e6052e

Digit is a fantastic business no doubt, but we at ZCharts are sticking with what Charlie Munger says: ""no matter how wonderful it is, it's not worth an infinite price"".

In general, a company, at a particular stage of the growth curve, applies for IPO. The primary target of these companies is to infuse cash into the system through IPO necessary for expansion. There are more reasons also. 

But for a startup, things are different. Earlier, SEBI only allowed such companies to float IPOs that have a total business value of 1000 crores or 1 billion rupees. This eligibility criterion was a little flexible for companies that have good growth prospects. And there were other prerequisites also. But when the startup companies grew SEBI found that they have very good growth prospects because of the products or services they offer. 

So, now we can find new startup companies coming up with IPOs. These companies are freshly founded and are not like the orthodox types of companies. These companies have new kinds of products or services that are well suited to changing business horizons. These companies do not follow the orthodox business routes. But they have tremendous business growth potential. SEBI also felt that these companies need to have access to huge capital to support their growth. Therefore, SEBI allowed them to exploit the IPO route that will allow these companies to infuse capital into their business plan. Also being a public limited company, the ownership will be divided among the shareholders who will purchase equity shares from the exchanges. 

This opportunity given by SEBI allowed these companies to grow fast. More and more startups are coming into the market and bringing IPOs. But for an investor buying IPOs, it is becoming hard for an investor to know about the companies from the historical data. Very little historical data is available for these companies because most of them are newly born companies.

So, what can an investor do when the investor wants to study the company before investing? Due to a lack of past data, it will be very hard to judge the company and form an idea of how they are going to perform in future. The investor should be worried about his/ her investment. He/ she will want to know whether his / her money is in good hands or not.

These are unique cases even for a hardened investor. Every investor wants to gather information about the company in which the investor is about to invest. But if there is not ample information available what can the investor do? Either he is not going to invest or he will try to delve into whatever resources are available to him. For the startup IPOs, the investor primarily has a voluminous document available known as the DRHF or the Draft Red Herring Prospectus. 

An investor must read the DRHP thoroughly. In order to gather information, the investor got to do the painstaking work of studying the voluminous document diligently and gathering all the required information. This is the only printed material that the investor has that the company submitted before SEBI to avail approval for IPO. SEBI makes it clear that all information given in the document is correct. SEBI has a team of experts who investigate the company and check all the credentials given in the DRHP. Therefore, it takes a long time to get approval after a company approaches SEBI for IPO. Once the document is cleared and the company is given a green signal to come out with the IPO, an investor can rely on the facts stated in DRHP to be true. 

Hence, the investor can rely on the facts given in the prospectus and find the weak points of the company. Else, there may be some conditions which the investor may think to be unjust and not invest in the company. To make the DRHP more digestible, we have given some guidelines on which the investor can judge the merits of the company. Let’s discuss the main aspects of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

· The DRHP at the first glance looks a little bit confusing. Keep aside your experience and look for the core business for which the startup is floating IPO. 

There is a completely separate section in which the company explains the detailed business model of the company, the product and everything about the company itself. The investor will get to know about the company. It is necessary for an investor to know the company, its location, its manufacturing unit and the business model.

Next, the business model is explained in the prospectus. You need to understand the business model and the product or services the company offers. If the investor knows and understands the product/ services and under how the market is going to accept that, a clear idea can be formed on how the revenue is going to come and help the company to make a profit. The company projects the path of future revenue and company growth. With the help of charts and data, everything is clearly explained. But the investor needs to understand it. 

An investor must understand the company and its business model to get a clear picture of the risk where the investor’s money is going to be invested. This is especially true for all startup IPOs. With minimum historical data on hand, the investor needs to be clear about the business model which will fetch revenue for the company.

· Just like the business details there is another section explaining the risk factors. In this section, the company explains all the details of financial and other risks the investor may be subjected to. The company also explains there how the risk factors can affect the business and future profitability of the company.

The investor must check out the major risk factors inherent to the company product or business model. Supposing, there is a raw material risk which is not readily available. Hence, the unavailability of raw materials will disrupt business and directly affect profitability. Understanding these major risk factors is important for an investor to realize how risky the investment is.

· Next comes another very important part, the financial statement. The investor can find all the details of moveable and unmoveable assets, liabilities, expenses, earnings till date, profit and profit after tax and the complete balance sheet. Some important company like CRR, P/E can be found. Also the present financial health indicators like cash reserve, cash inflow, cash in hand and present debt – all can be found in the financial statements. If it is found that cash reserve is not good, the company has high amount of debt etc. it is better to not to invest in that IPO because most of the proceeds will be spent to pay debt.

· As I mentioned earlier the prospectus show in details where and how the company is planning to spend the proceeds. If a company uses the main share of IPO money to pay the debt, that is not a good proposal. Paying the previous debt may make the company debt free, but this is a misutilisation of funds. Unless the company proposes to use the fund for the growth of the company and increase earning potential, why should an investor invest in a company to pay their past debt? An investor should keep away from it. 

· The company management and their past track record is an important determining factor. A good management team can make a company lead the race if the company basics are solid. Once you have gone through the financial statements and the use of proceeds and satisfied with what was written on the prospectus, your job is only half done. The prospectus say all about the management team and their experience in running such business, the founder investors and the promoters. 

If the management team has proven track record of running similar business successfully, you can be assured that your investment will be in good hands. A good business model, a worthy product/ services run under an efficient management team is good enough to make a business successful profit earning. Hence it is an omportant aspect to look for.

· After you are satisfied with the management team, next comes the founder investors and promoters. It is important to make an idea the true intention of the company to come up with the IPO. Past records found in digital archive may be useful. If the promoters have a notion to dump their shares in the open market after listing and after the lock-up period is over, the investor should not invest in that company. Past track records of any of the promoter can give a clue to that. If you even have least doubt about their intentions, you will think twice before investment. 

· The DRHP give details of the IPO. One should look into these details to find whether the promoter is going to sell its majority of shares through this IPO. This in itself is alarming. In addition, in IPO details you will find probable share price, number of shares, projected earnings per share and all other details related to IPO of the company. By finding the company ratios they can be compared with the peer company aleady in the stock market to get an idea about how the company is going to perform in future.

Given above is a rough guideline on how a company performance can be researched from the prospectus and a little help from internet. You can make a workable structure to investigate about the company and how it may perform after the IPO process is complete. An investor can make decisions on the basis of these findings on whether to invest in the IPO or not.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Indian stock market rally made investors richer by Rs 72 lakh crore in 2021  As if wanting to be an antidote to the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian stock market adorned carnival robes in 2021 with a tsunami of liquidity unleashed by global central banks coupled with supportive domestic policies and the world’s largest vaccination drive sparking off a world-beating rally on Dalal Street, despite bouts of uneasiness over fizzy valuations.

While the wider economy shuttled between recovery and relapse, dictated by multiple mutations of the virus, equity market benchmarks appeared headed in just one direction — skywards.

The dizzying upward journey has added a whopping Rs 72 lakh crore during 2021 to investors’ wealth, measured as the cumulative value of all listed shares in the country, taking it to nearly Rs 260 lakh crore.

In Indian stock market the BSE Sensex made history this year by breaching the 50,000-mark for the first time ever, and went on to scale the 60,000 level within the next seven months. It closed at its lifetime high of 61,765.59 on October 18.

Despite the year-end gyrations due to the Omicron threat, the 30-share benchmark has posted returns of nearly 20 per cent so far this year, eclipsing most of its global peers.

However, Sensex is also the most expensive large market in the world, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.11.

This means investors are paying Rs 27.11 for every rupee of future earnings of the 30 Sensex firms, compared to its previous 20-year average of 19.80. But, the Indian market is not the only one witnessing such exuberance.

Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, have pumped in trillions of dollars into the financial markets since the onset of the pandemic to boost liquidity and prop up growth.

The US Fed has been buying bonds worth USD 120 every month for the past one-and-a-half years, nearly doubling its balance sheet to an astounding USD 8.3 trillion.

This unprecedented sea of liquidity has induced what experts have termed the ‘everything bubble’ — an across-the-board increase in asset prices, be it stocks, real estate or commodities, not to mention more exotic instruments like crypto-currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Back home, the government and the RBI worked in tandem to reignite the animal spirit of the pandemic-battered economy.

The Reserve Bank has kept the policy rate at an all-time low of 4 per cent since May last year, while reiterating its commitment to maintaining an accommodative stance as long as required.

The Centre unleashed a slew of big bang reforms, including production-linked incentive schemes for multiple sectors, a Rs 100 lakh-crore PM Gati Shakti Master Plan for infrastructure development and an ambitious asset monetisation pipeline, among various other measures.

All this played out amid a colossal vaccination drive which enabled the reopening of the economy after the shock of COVID-19 lockdowns.

“The year started on a wave of optimism with the start of the vaccination program and the sharp revival of the economy. However, the intensity of the second wave tempered some of this initial optimism. This was soon followed by the return of inflation, led primarily by supply chain disruptions,” said Nitin Raheja, Executive Director, Head – Discretionary Equities, Julius Baer.

However, strong commitment on the part of central banks, both globally and domestically, towards ensuring strong revival in growth through the continuation of easy money policies saw liquidity remaining benign, fuelling strong inflows into financial markets and other risky assets, he noted.

“Multi-year low-interest rates, new generation reforms, adequate availability of capital and the revival of the real estate sector have created the framework for a multi-year earnings growth cycle, ” Raheja added.

Despite all these factors in favour, the market has a habit of teaching some very old lessons to some very new investors.

One such lesson was that valuations and fundamentals matter — as evidenced by the disastrous market debut of Paytm.

The Rs 18,300-crore IPO, India’s largest, was one of the most hyped listings in recent times and a major milestone in the country’s startup ecosystem.

However, in Indian stock market, the stock crashed 27 per cent on the very first day, and continued sinking in subsequent sessions. Currently trading in the range of Rs 1,360, the stock is yet to touch its issue price of Rs 2,150.

That apart, the coronavirus remains an unpredictable adversary for investors worldwide.

Just when countries had started reopening and the global economy was getting back on track, the highly-contagious Omicron variant emerged, triggering a fresh wave of cases and border restrictions.

With soaring inflation playing havoc with economies the world over, central banks too have started to dial back their stimulus measures.

The Fed has already begun tapering its bond-buying, and will wind down the quantitative easing program by early next year, to be followed by rate hikes.

The Bank of England earlier this month became the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the onset of the pandemic.

The tightening of ultra-loose monetary policies has subsequently led to a flight of foreign capital from emerging markets, including India.

After being net investors for the most part of the year, FPIs have been on a selling spree since October, offloading shares worth Rs 37,320 crore (as of December 24).

The relentless selling pressure, however, has been partially offset by a growing force in the domestic financial landscape – the retail investor.

Inflows from systematic investment plans (SIPs) crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time this year, as per data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).

Individual investors hold a higher share of the MF industry assets (54.9 per cent in November 2021, compared to 51.5 per cent in the same month last year). Not only that, 77 per cent of individual investor assets are held in equity-oriented schemes.

In Indian stock market the Investors are not shying away from direct participation in the equity markets as well.

While the number of demat accounts stood at 4.09 crore at the end of 2019-20 and 5.51 crore in 2020-21, the figure has already swelled to 7.38 crore this fiscal so far (as of October 31, 2021).

“The aftermath of the world’s biggest ever easy monetary policy and fiscal expenditure made equities attractive, and the equity market benefited even more as the economy re-opened. Increased money inflows in the financial system bought foreign money to emerging markets.

“The cascading effect of profits bought retail investors to the equity market, a global affair. Indirectly, pandemic did help some Indian economy sectors like IT, healthcare and exporters, (which) benefited from digitalization and global demand,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Adhering to the adage of making hay while the sun shines, Indian Inc too piled into the capital market with initial public offers (IPOs), raising a record-shattering Rs 1.18 lakh crore from over 60 issues.

The Street saw more initial share sales in 2021 than in the year past three years combined, both in terms of the number of listings and the amount raised.

With such high spirits all around, many market participants are asking themselves an uncomfortable question — how long will the good times last?

Most brokerages expect Sensex to post tepid returns in 2022, weighed by the already stretched valuations, hawkish central banks and an uncertain global recovery.

The looming threat of Omicron setting off another wave of the pandemic is the biggest short-term risk. But faith in the underlying India story remains intact.

“We think strong growth forecast in the medium term should support the valuations. We like the stability of macroeconomic parameters that should support consumption and investments, leading to continued earnings estimate upgrades,” analysts at BNP Paribas said earlier this month.

The party, it seems, for now, is destined to carry on.",1640866434.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/rs0frp/indian_stock_market_rally_made_investors_richer/

Reddit,infinity infoway ipo,"Standard Glass Lining IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are from personal observations. I’m not a SEBI-registered investor, kindly do your research before making investment decisions.

Last minute quick IPO analysis

1. Strong Company Fundamentals

Standard Glass Lining Technology provides a wide range of solutions that cover design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, installation, commissioning, and the establishment of standard operating procedures for pharmaceutical and chemical producers on a turnkey basis.

The company's revenue grew from ₹240.2 crore in FY22 to ₹543.7 crore in FY24, reflecting a CAGR of 50.5%. Similarly, PAT increased from ₹25.1 crore to ₹60.0 crore, with a CAGR of 55%, supported by its strategic partnerships and inorganic acquisitions.

Standard Glass Lining announced that it has secured ₹123 crore from anchor investors in advance of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹133 - ₹140 per share.

2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of the closing day of IPO, QIBs oversubscribed by issue by 4.67 times.

But it's also important to track and make sure that QIBs show early interest in the IPO instead of pitching in the list minute.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

In this case ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), Kotak MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, 3P Investment Managers, Kotak Infinity Fund - Class AC, ITI MF, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amansa Holdings, and Clarus Capital are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

However, a contrary example here is One97 IPO (Paytm), which had interest from several American players such as Vanguard and even Warren Buffet. However, many of them sold major portions of their investments, and Paytm’s share price is now several times lower than the listing price.

3. Issue size and split

It is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Standard Glass Lining Technology's ₹410.05 crore-worth IPO consists of a fresh issuance of equity shares worth ₹210 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to 1.43 crore shares worth Rs. 200.05 crores by its promoters and other selling stakeholders. More than 50% fresh issue is a decent number and brings credibility to the IPO.

4. Brand name and experienced Management

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

SGTL has experienced people in the management such as:

Mr. Nageswara Rao Kandula: Managing Director with over three decades of experience in creating glass-lined products that meet international standards for various chemically aggressive applications.

Mrs. Krishna Veni Kandula: Executive Director contributing to the company's strategic direction and operations.

Mr. Venkata Mohana Rao Katragadda: Executive Director involved in overseeing the company's engineering and manufacturing processes.

5. Attractive Valuation

At the upper price band company is valuing at P/E of 43.01x (against an industry average of 52x), with an EV/EBITDA of 30.08x and market cap of ₹2792 crores.

This reasonable valuation relative to its peers is a huge green flag.

6. Use of proceeds

The company plans to use ₹130 crore from the fresh issue to repay debts and allocate ₹30 crore for investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, S2 Engineering Industry.

Clearly defined use of proceeds is another reason to invest in the IPO.

Verdict: After a long time, we see an IPO that's worth applying. 100% worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736329987.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hwgjv3/standard_glass_lining_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth/

Reddit,amanta healthcare ipo,"Should you subscribe to the Anlon Healthcare IPO? RISKS explained!!! Anlon Healthcare, operational since 2017, specializes in manufacturing high-purity pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs. The company operates from a single WHO-GMP and ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Rajkot, Gujarat, with a current production capacity of 400 MTPA, utilized at 84% in FY25. The company's product portfolio has 65 commercialized products, with an additional 28 products in the pilot stage and 49 products under laboratory testing. Notably, Anlon is among the few Indian manufacturers of Loxoprofen Sodium Dihydrate, a specialized API used for pain management in conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and post-surgical recovery.

There are four segments: APIs (40.27% of revenue), Finished Dosage Formulations (53.12%), Nutraceuticals (6.61%), and other segments (0.01%). 

Let's understand the **IPO structure**

The IPO comprises entirely a fresh issue of 1.33 crore equity shares priced between ₹86-91 per share, with a face value of ₹10. The lot size is fixed at 164 shares. 

Now, I will talk about its **financial performance**



||
||
|**Metric** (₹ Crores)|**FY23**|**FY24**|**FY25**|
|Revenue|112.9|66.69|120.46|
|EBITDA|N/A|15.57 |32.38 |
|Net Profit|5.82|9.66|20.52 |



The P/E multiple of 14.3x positions Anlon at a significant discount to peers like AMI Organics (58.5x) and Supriya Lifesciences (29.3x). 

The company has outlined an ambitious expansion strategy centered on capacity enhancement and market diversification. Plans include establishing a new 700 MTPA manufacturing facility within 400 meters of the existing plant, which would increase total capacity to 1,100 MTPA.

**Use of IPO Proceeds** (₹121.03 crores):

1. Capital Expenditure: ₹30.72 crores (25.4%) for facility expansion
2. Working Capital: ₹43.15 crores (35.7%) for operational scaling
3. Debt Repayment: ₹5.00 crores (4.1%) for financial optimization
4. General Corporate Purposes: ₹42.16 crores (34.8%)

The company has filed 21 DMFs across regulated markets including the EU, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Jordan, and Pakistan. Approvals have been secured from ANVISA (Brazil), NMPA (China), and PMDA (Japan) for key products.

**But** Anlon Healthcare faces multiple high-impact risks that potential investors must carefully evaluate.

1. The company's entire manufacturing operation is concentrated in one facility in Rajkot, Gujarat. Any disruption from regulatory issues, natural disasters, or equipment failures could severely impact operations.
2. Approximately 77% of revenue comes from the top 10 customer. Loss of any major customer could significantly impact financial performance.
3.  Despite international regulatory approvals, exports constitute only 3% of total revenue.
4. The company's revenue pattern shows extreme fluctuations, dropping 40.9% in FY24 before surging 80.6% in FY25. So, there are questions about business predictability and sustainability.
5. Top 10 suppliers account for 90% of raw material procurement, creating supply chain vulnerability and potential margin pressure.
6. The API sector faces intense competition from Chinese manufacturers who benefit from cost advantages and scale. China controls approximately two-thirds of India's API imports, creating pricing pressure.
7. The chemical manufacturing sector faces increasing environmental regulations, with potential for production shutdowns due to compliance issues.

The Indian API market presents a robust growth opportunity, valued at $14.18 billion in 2025 and expected to reach $21.46 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 8.54%. India contributes 8.8% of global API production and benefits from the China+1 diversification strategy as global pharmaceutical companies seek alternative suppliers.

**VERDICT**

For Conservative Investors: **AVOID**

# For Growth-Oriented Investors: SELECTIVE CONSIDERATION

Reddit,amanta healthcare ipo,"Long term conviction/thesis for my stock picks All my holdings are LONG TERM only. I started serious direct stock investing from around March this year (so my returns look decent because of the run up since then). It represents 1/3rd of my total portfolio (1/3rd in MFs and 1/3rd in US equity). My goal is simple:- to buy and hold cash flow compounding machines for a long time.

Apar Industries - it was trading at a 52 week low and they were making high quality export level products. Now facing uncertainities due to tariffs.

Nuvama Wealth - major player in a fast growing sector of wealth management. Growing top line consistently at ~20% comprising mostly sticky recurring revenue. All this available at a PE of 24 and PEG < 1. Still a good buy imp, but a lot of competition in this sector.

Swiggy - I foolishly thought having everything in one platform might make customer acquisition cheaper and easier. But they are being out-executed by Zomato in every turn. I still believe this stock has more upside but not adding more.

PFC - Consistent compounder trading just about book value. Lending majorly to discoms so NPA isn't too high and growing revenue around 20%. Looking to add more as I see more growth due government push for capex and RBI's liquidity norms. I also see long term secular tailwinds for India's energy sector. (Plus div yield of 4%)

KPI Green - Growing top line at >50% and bottom line at 100% with PE of 30 in a sector with a lot of tailwinds such as renewables. No idea why this stock is so cheap. Looking to add more.

CAMS - a bet on increasing financialization of India and growth of SIPs in India. Trying toadd more toll gate businesses like this in my portfolio. Strong moat, dominant position in a duopoly with high switching costs. But growth is slowing and is not enough to sustain its current valuation.

CARE Ratings - again a low capex, high margin toll gate business with high barriers to entry. Credit rating agencies globally are considered one of the best businesses to own and always trade at a premium. Care Ratings is the fastest growing and cheapest rating agency in India so it was a no brainer. It is also backed by super investor Guy Spier.

PVR Inox - it is a turn around between. I believe movies are an integral part of India's growing out culture. And PVR Inox is a virtual monopoly in this space. But it is still a risky bet with a shaky balance sheet and shite quality of Indian movies today.

Coal India - monopoly in the coal space and available at a stupidly cheap valuation. High dividend yield. But margins depend on global coal prices.

Pricol - a monopoly in the instrument cluster space for two wheelers. I believe betting on two wheelers is safer than the auto space in India. Pricol is growing at almost 20% and I may add more if valuation stays or dips slightly.

Canara bank - trading below book value with decent growth in NII, low NPAs and high dividend yield. Looking to add more.

Stocks I am looking to add more in - KPI Green, Canara bank, Nuvama, Care Ratings, PFC.

Stocks I may exit after a year - Apar, Swiggy, Nestle, KEI.

Current Watchlist - NSDL (if it gets to IPO price), TD power systems (if it gets to 350-400 levels and tarrif concers are allayed), MCX (waiting for a dip), Adani Ports (due to the monopoly nature), Narayana Hrudalaya, Dr Agarwal's Healthcare.",1755929554.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxtsft

Reddit,amanta healthcare ipo,"i know it's over diversified and the portfolio is shit, but i need suggestions [This portfolio has a story better than Pushpa 2 lol. So half of the stocks were suggested by a random dude on instagram and idk how but 99&#37; of the time, his suggestions were spot on. Apparently he was part of a trading company. I made crazy gains thru him, but I deleted my instagram account out of some personal reasons. After that I decided to start my own research and few of the stocks are result of my research. My first bet was Zomato which went really really well. So instead of consolidating the existing companies, I started buying new shares. I agree this was a dumb decision. Then I got busy in my exams and didn't have much time to research. So I bought shares just on the company's name. Some of these shares are Mahindra Logistics, Paras, Exide Industries, TVS Supply Chain and others. As you can see, most of them did decently well. Then I applied for Hyundai IPO with literally zero research. I thought since it's a big IPO of a big company, it'll eventually go up. I know, again a dumb decision, but here we are. Now the problem is, I can't figure out which ones to hold and which one to sell. As of now, I don't have time to research all of them. I will start studying finance & stock market soon, as it is included in my syllabus, but it'll start after 4-5 months. Until then I wanted a starting point regarding my portfolio.

Reddit,amanta healthcare ipo,"Analysis of the healthcare sector in India! Fellow redditors, since all of you showcased so much love on my last post, I am here to contribute more to this sub and hopefully enhance the quality of posts here. Today, I am going to be doing an extensive analysis of the healthcare sector in India. I believe that this is a very underpenetrated zone with robust growth potential. 

Spoiler: For those who are looking for stock recommendations, I’m going to save you some time and tell you that there are none in this post. I am not going to step into the same zone as certain finfluencers and tell you guys what to buy since I am not an advisor, nor are most of them btw. I am going to be giving a broad overview of what I think the healthcare sector is going to look like in a few years, the growth triggers and the general valuations. 

For those who struggle with reading long posts, I would say this is the time for you to try and go to chat gpt to ask for a summary and for chatGPT to miss out on the majority of the statistics and points that I will try and put forth. This is exactly how you end up having weak convictions in businesses. 

The following are my personal views supported by market forecasts and statistics.

I am sure a lot of you must be seeing a significant consolidation in your portfolios for the past few months. It is also hard to point out exactly what triggers are impacting the market, I think it was overheated valuations, but some might say it was the US imposing tariffs, stronger dollar or reallocation to other undervalued markets. While some might complain about the market collapsing and that stocks will never reach the same levels again (not my comments but things I’ve read on this subreddit), I believe that this is a great time for accumulation. I know a lot of us might be struggling with the fact that you might be 100% invested in the markets, if that is the case then just hold on to fundamentally strong companies and you should be good. For those who have cash on hand, this is a golden opportunity to slowly accumulate. 

Now coming to the healthcare industry. What is interesting to watch in market downturns is the fact that because investor sentiment is low and the markets are fearful, people tend to offload stock from all sectors, even the ones that might be doing well and are growing at a good pace. The great thing about this sector is that it cannot be impacted much by foreign policies or tariffs unlike the IT sector. India remains a highly under-penetrated zone when it comes to hospitals and there is a huge demand for more infrastructure. 

https://preview.redd.it/p9apgjlfvpje1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e3a915fb377dc696f0a1921756a9fcd9285f5de

When you have a look at this image, you can clearly see the lack of infrastructure we have. This was also highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was a large shortfall of availability of beds in hospitals. Since our population is similar to China, I would assume that our basic requirements should be close to theirs. I would not say that we should expect the average to go all the way up to 50 but I would assume somewhere around the 35 scale should be the target. This is again my own analysis; I would hope that we can at least achieve the world average. This is trigger number one.

Furthermore, since we all know the AQI levels around the country, which btw I don’t think will become better anytime soon, this will lead to further health issues in the long term. These are long term opportunities. Take major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Haryana where air quality is at its worst, people residing there will definitely need to seek medical services in the long term, nobody can sustain such harmful toxins. This is exactly why hospitals in North India are growing at a much faster pace when compared to any other side in India. 

https://preview.redd.it/pouj1e2dvpje1.jpg?width=1180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14aad56bafaf19aeb1520fdcba8a35c58c5844ca

Even if we consider a mid-point growth of 10% Y-o-Y, then we can see just how big of a market this would be going in the future. The good thing about this is that we are currently at a stage where hospitals are rapidly expanding and you will see a lot of private chains making several acquisitions, this is all because they know the opportunities that lie ahead. Another major thing to consider is that government only has a fixed amount of Capex that they can deploy to fund or expand hospitals, which is why the burden is on the private sector to grow and fill the necessary gaps, this is really beneficial because we have a lot of private players who are already listed and some who are ready for an IPO. This is exactly why you will be seeing a shift in the market share that private hospitals have. Below is the forecasted change. 

[I believe that this is a very conservative forecast](https://preview.redd.it/q613rfawupje1.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e97a161c55ddcc21ccbae53bc3f6744e51b1efc)

Another important thing to keep an eye out for is the fact that the government has launched the ‘Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)’. For those of you who are not aware of this policy, this is an initiative that the government has taken to provide health coverage to all senior citizens of the age 70 years and above irrespective of income. This is aimed to benefit around 4.5 crore families. This is huge! This means that going forward people would prefer to seek private healthcare because they have a coverage of up to 5 lakhs. You can read more about this here:[AB PM-JAY | Prime minister of India](https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-health-coverage-to-all-senior-citizens-of-the-age-70-years-and-above-irrespective-of-income-under-ayushman-bharat-pradhan-mantri-jan-arogya-yojana-ab-pm-jay/). It has not even been a full year since the rollout began, which means that going forward we can see a lot more people visiting private hospitals. This is trigger number two. 

https://preview.redd.it/eetra9y3vpje1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcdf7bb4285de28e9bc37232b3e7f25f75126d34

There is clearly a very low concentration of private sector penetration, and this graph helps us visualize the market that is yet to be penetrated. 

Trigger number three is how cheap our medical facilities are when compared to the rest of the world. India holds a big price moat over the rest of the world when it comes to medical services. This is why we are witnessing a wave of medical tourism in India. This was something that was also mentioned in Budget 2025, the idea of “Heal in India”. This is an initiative that has the potential to bring a lot of money to India and obviously the government sees that and is trying to provide streamlined e-visa facilities along with visa-fee waivers for certain tourist groups. I would highly encourage you to read this: [Press Release: Press Information Bureau](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2099519). Below are the price comparisons between major countries to prices in India and you can clearly see the difference. 

https://preview.redd.it/0xzwggizupje1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2be4c9b78103c114f8a6815fa75fe27a23286ff

Medical tourism is growing at a very high pace at the moment. There was a time during the pandemic where it had slipped significantly, but we are starting to see a strong bounceback. I believe that if the sector plays its card correctly, then we can see a massive inflow of money. You can compare this to medical tourism in Korea as well; there is a significant incentive for people to fly to Korea for plastic surgeries due to the significant price difference. Their economy has massively benefitted from this! I believe that there are opportunities for our market to grow beyond that scale just because of our price competitiveness. 

[I believe that this forecast is pretty conservative, and that India has the potential to attract more than 30 lakh tourists by 2030e. ](https://preview.redd.it/qvhh5cr0vpje1.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceccd913db372a47f3819f4dd700f17c8e8e4512)

India is also starting to see more people buying health cover than before. This is very interesting because more people holding health insurance means that people would be visiting for every health issue they have instead of trying to seek cheap remedies and fixing the issue by themselves. Companies are also starting to offer health insurance as part of their employees' overall package, this means that more people are going to be holding more insurance policies going forward.

Something to keep an eye out for is that several healthcare companies have seen their shares significantly fall in the past months, even though most of the companies reported decent to good earnings. It is also important to point out that unlike a lot of sectors, healthcare is not cyclical, people don’t choose when they want to fall sick, therefore these are stocks which, regardless of market conditions, should be reporting numbers that are in-line with expectations. 

Some of the companies are available at great valuation at this point and there are also some that are trading at crazy prices. I would highly recommend that you do your due diligence of which business you want to invest in and try keeping an eye out for the points that I have highlighted. Good companies would be expanding and trying to capture the medical tourism market. Look for their geographical locations, the markets they are trying to cover and the level of specializations that they offer at their hospitals. I believe that this sector gets overlooked quite often by investors, however I feel that going forward, it has the opportunity to generate great wealth for investors. 

Of course, I cannot cover every single incentive or trigger for this industry in a single post, however I hope I have given you some coverage of what stage our country is currently at and what we can expect going forward. I would encourage you to do your own research to develop your own conviction. 

Would love to hear your opinions about this post and sector in the comments!

Reddit,amanta healthcare ipo,"Laxmi Dental IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Based on the below parameters, the IPO has been reviewed:

**1. Strong Company Fundamentals**

Laxmi Dental is a leading dental healthcare provider in India, offering a range of dental services including dental implants, orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry, and more. The company has a pan-India presence with a network of clinics.

The company's revenue grew by 19.75% from ₹161.63 crore in FY23 to ₹193.56 crore in FY24. Even better is that the profits saw a remarkable turnaround, from ₹4.16 crore loss in FY23 to a profit of ₹25.23 crore in FY24, marking an improvement of 706.49%.

The company has also announced that it has secured ₹314 crore from anchor investors ahead of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹407 - ₹428 per share

**2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors**

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion of Laxmi Dental remains undersubscribed with only 0.44 times subscribed or 0.59 times, according to various sources.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

As of Laxmi Dental, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (MF), ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Kotak MF, Mirae Asset MF, Tata MF, Birla Sunlife Insurance, Max Life Insurance, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, Al Mehwar Commercial Investments and Natixis Investment Managers are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

**3. Issue size and split**

The fresh issue size should preferably not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Laxmi Dental's ₹698.06 Cr worth IPO consists of fresh issuance of 0.32 crore equity shares worth ₹138.00 crores and offer for sale of 1.31 crore shares aggregating to Rs 560.06 crores. The split here is 19% fresh issue and 81% OFS. Less than 50% fresh issue is a mediocre number and doesn't bring much credibility to the IPO.

**4. Brand name and experienced Management**

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

Laxmi Dental's leadership team comprises individuals with extensive experience in the dental industry:

* **Mr. Rajesh Khakhar and Mr. Sameer Merchant:** Founder Mr. Khakhar along with co-founder Mr. Merchant has been instrumental and played a pivotal role in providing advanced orthodontic solutions, contributing significantly to the company's growth and bringing advancements in Digital Dentistry and introducing new technologies.

**5. Attractive Valuation**

At the upper price band company is valuing at a P/E of 94.11x. Also based on FY24 earnings, the P/E ratio rises to 130.87, indicating that the issue is priced aggressively. 

As per the high valuation, the earnings and profits growth also have to grow similarly so that the valuation is justified.

**6. Use of proceeds**

The company plans to utilize ₹138 crore from the fresh issue to support several strategic objectives, including the repayment or prepayment, in full or part, of certain outstanding borrowings by the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Additionally, as per the RHP, funds will be allocated toward capital expenditure requirements, such as the acquisition of new machinery for the company and its subsidiary, Bizdent Devices Private Limited. The rest of the amount will be utilized by the company for general corporate purposes.

**Verdict:**

The IPO is worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736856511.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i14mp2/laxmi_dental_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth_diving_in/

Reddit,amanta healthcare ipo,"Indian stock market rally made investors richer by Rs 72 lakh crore in 2021  As if wanting to be an antidote to the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian stock market adorned carnival robes in 2021 with a tsunami of liquidity unleashed by global central banks coupled with supportive domestic policies and the world’s largest vaccination drive sparking off a world-beating rally on Dalal Street, despite bouts of uneasiness over fizzy valuations.

While the wider economy shuttled between recovery and relapse, dictated by multiple mutations of the virus, equity market benchmarks appeared headed in just one direction — skywards.

The dizzying upward journey has added a whopping Rs 72 lakh crore during 2021 to investors’ wealth, measured as the cumulative value of all listed shares in the country, taking it to nearly Rs 260 lakh crore.

In Indian stock market the BSE Sensex made history this year by breaching the 50,000-mark for the first time ever, and went on to scale the 60,000 level within the next seven months. It closed at its lifetime high of 61,765.59 on October 18.

Despite the year-end gyrations due to the Omicron threat, the 30-share benchmark has posted returns of nearly 20 per cent so far this year, eclipsing most of its global peers.

However, Sensex is also the most expensive large market in the world, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.11.

This means investors are paying Rs 27.11 for every rupee of future earnings of the 30 Sensex firms, compared to its previous 20-year average of 19.80. But, the Indian market is not the only one witnessing such exuberance.

Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, have pumped in trillions of dollars into the financial markets since the onset of the pandemic to boost liquidity and prop up growth.

The US Fed has been buying bonds worth USD 120 every month for the past one-and-a-half years, nearly doubling its balance sheet to an astounding USD 8.3 trillion.

This unprecedented sea of liquidity has induced what experts have termed the ‘everything bubble’ — an across-the-board increase in asset prices, be it stocks, real estate or commodities, not to mention more exotic instruments like crypto-currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Back home, the government and the RBI worked in tandem to reignite the animal spirit of the pandemic-battered economy.

The Reserve Bank has kept the policy rate at an all-time low of 4 per cent since May last year, while reiterating its commitment to maintaining an accommodative stance as long as required.

The Centre unleashed a slew of big bang reforms, including production-linked incentive schemes for multiple sectors, a Rs 100 lakh-crore PM Gati Shakti Master Plan for infrastructure development and an ambitious asset monetisation pipeline, among various other measures.

All this played out amid a colossal vaccination drive which enabled the reopening of the economy after the shock of COVID-19 lockdowns.

“The year started on a wave of optimism with the start of the vaccination program and the sharp revival of the economy. However, the intensity of the second wave tempered some of this initial optimism. This was soon followed by the return of inflation, led primarily by supply chain disruptions,” said Nitin Raheja, Executive Director, Head – Discretionary Equities, Julius Baer.

However, strong commitment on the part of central banks, both globally and domestically, towards ensuring strong revival in growth through the continuation of easy money policies saw liquidity remaining benign, fuelling strong inflows into financial markets and other risky assets, he noted.

“Multi-year low-interest rates, new generation reforms, adequate availability of capital and the revival of the real estate sector have created the framework for a multi-year earnings growth cycle, ” Raheja added.

Despite all these factors in favour, the market has a habit of teaching some very old lessons to some very new investors.

One such lesson was that valuations and fundamentals matter — as evidenced by the disastrous market debut of Paytm.

The Rs 18,300-crore IPO, India’s largest, was one of the most hyped listings in recent times and a major milestone in the country’s startup ecosystem.

However, in Indian stock market, the stock crashed 27 per cent on the very first day, and continued sinking in subsequent sessions. Currently trading in the range of Rs 1,360, the stock is yet to touch its issue price of Rs 2,150.

That apart, the coronavirus remains an unpredictable adversary for investors worldwide.

Just when countries had started reopening and the global economy was getting back on track, the highly-contagious Omicron variant emerged, triggering a fresh wave of cases and border restrictions.

With soaring inflation playing havoc with economies the world over, central banks too have started to dial back their stimulus measures.

The Fed has already begun tapering its bond-buying, and will wind down the quantitative easing program by early next year, to be followed by rate hikes.

The Bank of England earlier this month became the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the onset of the pandemic.

The tightening of ultra-loose monetary policies has subsequently led to a flight of foreign capital from emerging markets, including India.

After being net investors for the most part of the year, FPIs have been on a selling spree since October, offloading shares worth Rs 37,320 crore (as of December 24).

The relentless selling pressure, however, has been partially offset by a growing force in the domestic financial landscape – the retail investor.

Inflows from systematic investment plans (SIPs) crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time this year, as per data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).

Individual investors hold a higher share of the MF industry assets (54.9 per cent in November 2021, compared to 51.5 per cent in the same month last year). Not only that, 77 per cent of individual investor assets are held in equity-oriented schemes.

In Indian stock market the Investors are not shying away from direct participation in the equity markets as well.

While the number of demat accounts stood at 4.09 crore at the end of 2019-20 and 5.51 crore in 2020-21, the figure has already swelled to 7.38 crore this fiscal so far (as of October 31, 2021).

“The aftermath of the world’s biggest ever easy monetary policy and fiscal expenditure made equities attractive, and the equity market benefited even more as the economy re-opened. Increased money inflows in the financial system bought foreign money to emerging markets.

“The cascading effect of profits bought retail investors to the equity market, a global affair. Indirectly, pandemic did help some Indian economy sectors like IT, healthcare and exporters, (which) benefited from digitalization and global demand,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Adhering to the adage of making hay while the sun shines, Indian Inc too piled into the capital market with initial public offers (IPOs), raising a record-shattering Rs 1.18 lakh crore from over 60 issues.

The Street saw more initial share sales in 2021 than in the year past three years combined, both in terms of the number of listings and the amount raised.

With such high spirits all around, many market participants are asking themselves an uncomfortable question — how long will the good times last?

Most brokerages expect Sensex to post tepid returns in 2022, weighed by the already stretched valuations, hawkish central banks and an uncertain global recovery.

The looming threat of Omicron setting off another wave of the pandemic is the biggest short-term risk. But faith in the underlying India story remains intact.

“We think strong growth forecast in the medium term should support the valuations. We like the stability of macroeconomic parameters that should support consumption and investments, leading to continued earnings estimate upgrades,” analysts at BNP Paribas said earlier this month.

The party, it seems, for now, is destined to carry on.",1640866434.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/rs0frp/indian_stock_market_rally_made_investors_richer/

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Urban Company IPO: Beyond the Grey Market Buzz — A Bottom-up Analysis Urban Company’s IPO is drawing a lot of attention, and for good reason. Here’s a structured look at the issue for investors who want to go beyond the headlines.

**IPO Snapshot**

* Issue size: ₹1,900 crore
* Fresh issue: \~₹472 crore
* Offer for Sale (OFS): \~₹1,428 crore
* Price band: ₹98 – ₹103
* Bidding window: September 10–12, 2025
* Lot size: 145 shares (≈₹14,935 at the upper band for retail)

**Financials**  
FY25 was a turning point. The company posted a net profit of \~₹239.8 crore against losses in prior years, with revenue up by \~38%. The profit was aided by one-time tax credits, but it also reflects improved operating leverage and better unit economics.

**Grey Market Premium (GMP)**  
The GMP has moved up from ₹10 to around ₹28–30 per share, implying potential listing gains of 27–30%. While this signals strong demand, it also sharpens questions about whether valuations are running ahead of fundamentals.

**Why This IPO Matters**

* One of the few tech-enabled services IPOs in 2025, testing investor appetite for the gig-economy model.
* Asset-light business spanning home services, product sales, and international markets (UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia).
* Proceeds earmarked for technology upgrades, cloud infrastructure, office expansion, and marketing — geared toward growth rather than balance sheet repair.

**Key Risks**

* Sustainability of FY25 profitability remains to be proven.
* High competition, aggressive customer acquisition spends, reliance on gig workers, and potential regulatory headwinds.
* Heavy OFS component — a large portion of the issue involves existing shareholders exiting, which could influence supply dynamics post-listing.

Urban Company’s IPO is more than just a listing event. It marks a milestone in India’s evolving gig economy. The opportunity is genuine — but so are the execution risks.",1757321111.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nbig3o/urban_company_ipo_beyond_the_grey_market_buzz_a/

**Points to consider**  
  
  
Top 5 states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telengana, Gujarat, Delhi constitute 85% of AUM, any adverse calamity in these states would negatively affect the company.  
  
Large exposure in residential and commercial real estate hence any downturn in this sector might affect Bajaj housing finance negatively.  
  
As it is non-deposit taking NBFCs, it relies on borrowings and hence any impact on interest rate might affect them negatively. 44% of borrowings are at fixed interest rates, 56% of borrowings at floating interest rates whereas 99.8% of loans advanced are in floating interest rates.  
  
Their key business strengths lie in strong parentage , diversified funding sources , vast network and risk management (one of the best HFC’s in capital & profitability ratios).  
  
Bajaj finance holds 100% of BHFL, wherein just 1 year before RHP filing they invested approx Rs 2,000 cr as an equity by acquiring 110,74,19,709 shares at Rs 18.1  
  
Average ticket size being 46 lakhs, BHFL caters to premium housing customers, which is growing at 13-15% CAGR. Also it is easy to lend being high ticket vs Affordable housing finance cos with 10 lakh ticket size.  
  
BHFL has grown at stellar speed, just in 8 years AUM of 97000cr, last 2 year AUM CAGR of 31% and PAT CAGR of 56%- all because of huge customer database of Bajaj Finance. It is said data is the most important moat for Bajaj Finance.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"My biggest mistake till now will be Saraswati IPO With such great fundamentals, I bough the stock at 202, the next day after UC.

But it is shocking that neeche hi jaa raha bhai, I feel I have loss money, and its better to remove it now.

20% down hai, ab aur kitna hi neeche jaane ka wait karu aur kitna hi upar aayega.

But tbh with such great fundamentals why this is happening?


Edit: I am new in Market, its been 2 - 3 months, can someone tell / teach exactly when to enter a stock, because whenever I want to enter a stock, it is running high.

When I enter that stock, it runs low.

For example, Tvs electronic, 2 days back I entered the market, where it was running 63 pts high, and next day 40 - 50 pts kamm ho gaye.

**Industry overview**  
  
  
The Global PV sales in CY2023 was dominated by Toyota Group at 11.1 million, followed by Volkswagen Group with 9.2 million units and Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai + Kia) with 7.3 million units, with **Hyundai group being 3rd largest global passenger vehicle ( PV) maker.**  
  
**According to CRISIL MI&A, India had 26 cars per 1,000 people as of Fiscal 2024.** Although the penetration grew from 22 cars per 1000 people in Fiscals 2019 to 26 cars as of Fiscal 2024, it is significantly lower than the developed nations and even emerging nations like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. This provides significant headroom for growth, especially given the expected increase in disposable incomes, faster economic growth, younger population, and increased focus from international OEMs.  
  
As per CRISIL MI&A, Indian economy is expected to surpass US$5 trillion mark over the next seven fiscals (2025- 2031) and inching closer to US$7 trillion. A projected average GDP growth of 6.7% in this period will make India the third-largest economy in the world and lift per capita income to the upper middle-income category. **By Fiscal 2031, India’s per capita income will rise to approximately US$4,500, thereby making it an upper middle-income nation.**  
  
Between FY19 and FY24 , India’s domestic PV sales volume rose at 5% CAGR. This growth was despite the sales contraction (at 10% CAGR) witnessed during Fiscals 2019 to 2021. Sales were 3.9 million vehicles in Fiscal 2023. **CRISIL MI&A expects the industry to clock 4.5-6.5% CAGR between FY24 to FY29 period to reach 5.2-5.7 million domestic vehicle sales.**  
  
**Premiumization trend in Cars**

B/w FY21 and FY23 , car industry by value increased by 36% due to- premiumization- preference of SUVs- increase in prices due to emission norms-raw material price hike

**ASP( Avg selling price) rose from 491000rs to 659000rs b/w FY19 and FY23.**  
  
**Segment share of SUVs rose from 23% to 50% in FY24 at 23% CAGR.** Recognizing the changing consumer preferences, OEMs also launched higher number of vehicles in the SUV segment. The mid-size SUV segment (24% CAGR) outpaced the entire SUV segment. Continued traction for the high selling models like Hyundai Creta & Kia Seltos as well as Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Urban cruiser Hyryder, and Honda Elevate provided the thrust to the growth of mid-size SUVs. **The share of small cars (hatchbacks) reduced from 46.9% in Fiscal 2019 to 34.4% in Fiscal 2023.**  
  
The hatchbacks segment lost market share owing to  
- lack of new model launches  
-frequent hikes in vehicle prices  
-increase in operating costs amid fuel price hikes  
-an unfavourable macroeconomic environment that impacted the price sensitive entry-level customer base  
  
  
Domestic PV industry is an oligopolistic market with few players dominating the entire industry. Maruti Suzuki is the market leader ,Hyundai Motor India second largest contributor to the domestic sales, followed by Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. These 4 players together contribute approximately 80% of the market.

**Operating metrics**  
  
Hyundai has sold following number of cars in FY24-  
ICE 506,250  
CNG 60,320  
EV 975  
  
Hyundai has lost some share in the hatchbacks segment in the last 5 years. Discontinuation of its compact hatchbacks Santro and Eon impacted the company’s share within the hatchbacks segment. Intensified competition with entry of new models Tata Altroz and Toyota Glanza in the premium hatchbacks segment exerted pressure on its share in the premium hatchbacks sub-segment in the last 5 years.  
  
In the compact sedans segment, Maruti Suzuki leads with a market share of approximately 58.5%, from the Dzire model. **Following Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai holds a share of around 19.8%, attributed to Aura model.** **In the premium sedans segment, Hyundai Motor India dominates with a 31.2% market share**, driven by sale of its only model Verna.  
  
Compared to other segments, the SUV segment is much more fragmented with no clear leader and very close competition between the OEMs. Hyundai dominates the mid-size SUV sub segment. **With its flagship model Creta, Hyundai commanded a leading 30% market share.**

**Points to consider**  


Entire Auto industry is standing at crossroads to move on towards renewable energy like EV, CNG, Hybrid- so lot of technological change related investments has to be made by all players in coming few years. It is not clear which technology will emerge as winner, so incumbents must invest in all of them.  
  
**Top 5 suppliers constitute 44% of materials and top 10 suppliers constitute 59% of materials.17% of parts are sourced from Korea.**

**Hyundai has to pay 3.5% of revenues as royalty cost to HMC for R&D and manufacturing technology transfer.**  
  
Related party transactions in expenses side is 32% and 9% on the sales side.  
  
**HMC holds 34.16% stake in Kia Corporation** which operates in the automobile industry in India through its subsidiary, Kia India Private Limited. HMC’s chairman is also the chairman of Kia. HMI also supplies engines to Kia for their vehicles. Given the potential product overlaps between HMI's offerings and those of Kia in India, there is no assurance that conflicts of interest won't happen in future.  
  
12% of sales come from Middle East/Europe , 7% of sales come from Latin America, 4% from Africa, **so dependence on Exports is there for 23% of revenues.**  
  
**Capacity utilization in 9M FY24 is 97% , so until Talegaon plant comes up ( H2 FY26), there is capacity constraints for Hyundai**.

 Debt/ equity ratio at 0.87

**Points to consider**  


1. **Sharp fluctuations in natural gas prices** can severely dent the margins of gas distribution players like IRM Energy, similar to what happened in FY23.  (Russia- Ukraine war)  


2. Govt push to shift to cleaner fuels coupled with initiatives of companies to CNG conversion will aid usage of CNG in commercial vehicles. **But cost competitiveness of CNG as auto-fuel in private cars** ( assuming mostly sedans are sold) **are not very significant** for most users ( 1000km/ month usage) who user cars occasionally on weekends.  


3. **CGD sector is seeing huge investments of 1.2 lakh crores in coming years** owing to increased urbanization and further improvement in penetration. Adani Total Gas alone has announced Rs 20000cr investment by 2030 in CGD. Further investments of these companies are in EV charging stations, biofuels.  


4. **IRM Energy has invested in bio fuels, waste management, EV charging infra.** Though other bigger peers are diversifying in bio fuels, waste management, EV charging stations- one has to look into closely whether bio fuels, waste management investment at this stage also by IRM Energy is running on debt and still small in size compared to peers without using that capital to grow core business will be beneficial or not.  
EV charging stations can be a natural value addition at CNG filling stations.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"WHat do you prefer- an IPO or a listed company? Choosing between an IPO and investing in a listed company depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Here’s a balanced perspective:

# IPOs

* **Pros**: Potential for high returns if the company performs well post-IPO, the excitement of investing early in a promising business.
* **Cons**: Higher risk due to volatility and limited historical data, potential for overvaluation.

# Listed Companies

* **Pros**: More stability and historical performance to analyze, established business models, often provide dividends.
* **Cons**: Growth potential may be lower compared to new IPOs, and competition can be more intense in mature markets.

# Conclusion

If I had to choose, I would prefer investing in listed companies for their stability and data transparency, especially for long-term investments. However, IPOs can be attractive for those willing to take on more risk for potentially higher rewards. Ultimately, it depends on the specific circumstances and market conditions.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"What is IPO in the stock market, and when does a company go for an IPO?
 An **IPO (Initial Public Offering)** in the stock market is the process through which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. This marks the transition of the company from being privately held to being publicly traded on a stock exchange.

# When Does a Company Go for an IPO?

A company typically decides to go for an IPO for several reasons:

1. **Raising Capital:**
   * The primary reason for an IPO is to raise capital to fund expansion, research and development, pay off existing debt, or invest in new projects.
2. **Increasing Visibility and Credibility:**
   * Going public can increase a company's visibility and credibility in the market, making it easier to attract customers, partners, and further investments.
3. **Providing Liquidity to Early Investors:**
   * An IPO allows early investors, including venture capitalists and company founders, to sell some or all of their shares, thereby realizing gains on their initial investments.
4. **Employee Compensation:**
   * Companies may use stock options as a form of employee compensation. Going public provides a way for employees to convert their stock options into cash by selling them in the open market.
5. **Facilitating Future Capital Raises:**
   * Once public, a company can more easily raise additional funds in the future through secondary offerings or issuing more shares, as it already has access to the public market.

An IPO is a significant milestone for a company, representing growth, maturity, and a new chapter in its business journey.",1725345363.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1f7t83p/what_is_ipo_in_the_stock_market_and_when_does_a/

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Why I think IREDA will be a multi-bagger with 300% potential I think IREDA is a Multi-bagger stock that can grow by 300-400% in around 1-2years. Here are my reasons.

This is **not** a copy-paste, but entirely my own research. Source of most of the company data is Red Herring Prospectus available [here](https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/nov-2023/indian-renewable-energy-development-agency-limited-rhp_79087.html) but other relvent info is my personal research and understanding of the industry.

This is shared for educational purposes. Both mine and yours. I had no plans to write this, but when I researched and wrote points for my own investment, it become detailed enough that I thought of putting slightly more effort and making it into an article.

# Business model

&#x200B;

* IREDA is a central govt company made in 1987 to specifically give loans to renewable energy projects in India.
* Currently, it is the largest renewable energy financing company in India and have given out loans nearing 50000crores.
* IREDA's business is quite simple to understand yet many do not understand. They basically takes loans at 6.23% interest and then use that money to give loans to big renewable energy projects at average interest of around 10%, thus profiting 4% of everything they borrow!
* It is beneficial for companies that take these loans too as 10% is still a much lower interest rate than many other business loans from other sources. Thus win-win.
* People see the large debt and is wary of investing in a company with debt, that maybe true for normal companies but not for finance companies. Here they are all very good debt and this is exactly how all financial companies make money. More debt means more money to lend, and make more money.
* Their borrowing rate is the lowest among their peers. They borrow about half from domestic sources like RBI and bonds and the other half from foreign green investors including Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Asian Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement and the World Bank.
* The average cost of borrowing of IREDA is 6.23% in 2023. Other financing companies like REC limited have 6.96% and Power Finance Corporation Limited have 7.1% interest for the loans they borrow. Being able to borrow for such low rates, even less than Fixed-Deposits is the biggest advantage for a finance company.

# Why Low risk

# 

* Their main customers are large solar power plants and wind mills. More than 46% of their customers have made a legal agreement with the government(PPA) for the price at which govt will buy electricity from them. This is a permanent agreement that cannot be altered. This agreement was done to encourage renewable energy investments in India.
* So, a company that started in 2014 may have an agreement to sell electricity at a higher rate than a company that started in 2019 because cost of investment was higher in 2014.
* This basically guarantees profits no matter which year a renewable energy company was started as this fixed price means these solar/wind companies are guaranteed to get revenue from govt and thus guaranteed to pay their loans. There have been couple of instances of state govts wanting to get out of this agreement like in Andra Pradesh, but the govt eventually lost the case in court.
* The Andhra Pradesh high court gave order in 2022 that power contracts cannot be renegotiated and asked the state to clear dues estimated at Rs 30,000 crore to renewable energy generators in six weeks.
* But apart from that 93.4% of the loans are secured with collateral, so if the company is unable to pay in the worst case, IREDA can liquidate their collateral to recover money.
* 99.6% of the loan taking customers have taken compulsory insurance against natural disasters like Earthquake, flood, cyclone etc. So, there is no risk from disasters.
* 94.3% of the loans are given on floating interest rate, meaning the interest-payment is linked to inflation, thus there is no inflation risk to IREDA.
* 20 biggest customers account for 40% of the total loans given.
* IREDA has given loans in 23 states, so the political risk is spread across India.
* Only 1.66% of the loans given have turned out to be Non performing assets(NPAs). The net NPAs exhibited improvement, decreasing from 3.12% to 1.66% in FY23
* Out of this 1.6%, more than 70% were the loans given to Biomass plants and hydro plants, both of which were a learning experience for the company. The solar and wind are the main areas of expected growth in next 6 years, so I think NPA percentage will further come down.

# Why high value

# 

* Generally, Govt PSUs are huge companies in the 50k+ range market cap. But this one is a 8k market cap company. It is basically a government startup that is in a highly lucrative field that is about to blow up.
* Government companies are generally inefficient at doing complicated projects. Like HAL has to make fighterjets. Mazagon have to make ships.  All of them are too complicated, and easy for govt company to messup. But here it is a simple business model with low number of employees required.
* They just have 175 employees, but with an average experience of 18years! Basically like a startup, but focused on one thing only.
* Government companies that has too many customers are also generally inefficient like Air India, Railways or BSNL. But, here they have one of the lowest number of customers. Thus it is easy for a govt company to manage and give good service.
* Govt is currently looking to monetize its companies and earn dividends every year. So, new guidelines says all central public sector enterprise are required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth. IREDA is a profit making company for a long time. Thus, it will give good dividend in future too.
* Govt companies generally lists showing their actual value, and is not incentivized to list at blown up valuations. Here the net worth of the company is 6,580 crore. And the market cap is 8600 crore at Rs32 per share. Considering stock market is forward looking, there is huge scope for growth.
* India has committed to make 500GW of renewable energy by 2030. That is MASSIVE. India's total energy consumption from all sources currently is for example 190GW.
* India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 70.10 GW as of July 2023
* IREDA was the financier of 22GW of renewable energy in India as of now including partially financing the largest solar power plant in the world.
* Prime minister Modi had infused 1500 crore just last year into IREDA to fast up the growth of renewable energy. This shows clear govt support for this company. But anyway my point is that 1500 crore out of 6500 crore networth of the company is direct funds from last year given for free by govt.
* Even after this IPO, 75% of the stock will still be owned by the central government, thus they are committed in the growth of this company.
* IREDA also fully owns a 50MW solar power plant in Kerala that generates 28crore per year revenue.

&#x200B;

# The current timing is awesome

&#x200B;

* 58000 crore worth of money was used to apply for IREDA IPO of just 2150 crore. Last week saw the biggest IPOs of this year. 5 IPOs that came in the week totaling 2.6lakh crore, total of 2.6lakh crore were invested. This is largest amount ever invested in a week in Indian history.
* Among these 5 stocks, IREDA will be the first to get listed, and there is  gap for others to be listed.
* More than 2.5lakh crore of this locked-up capital will be unfrozen just before IREDA is listed.
* This can cause it to show unprecedented demand when all of these people who have not got any IPO will look at buying the first IPO that got listed.
* But it will take people some time to realize this value, and stocks are forward looking, so I think in around 1-2years people will realize the potential and the price will skyrocket.
* Two years ago a similar PSU company IRFC which lends money to Railways went for IPO. It was priced at 26 rupees. But got listed at a loss of 3.5%. Its share price increase to 90 when people realized its value.
* IRFC was only subscribed 3x by QIBs. This time IREDA is 104x subscription from QIBs. There is clear interests from banks, mutual funds and govt institutions for investing in IREDA with long term view.
* IRFC lends only to railways. The scope of IREDA is substantially bigger, and is at the right time when renewable has finally become viable.
* Currently there is a trend of PSUs generally skyrocketing few years after IPO. Look at what happened to Irfc, Rvnl, IRCTC and Mazgaon.

# Growth

IREDA has enough space to grow in the next 6 years. And even at 5x the IPO price, it will be a company under 50k crore market capitalization. Since stock market is forward looking, it is possible that big funds will also go long on this much before than the actual value of the company reaches there.  And the size of the company is small enough for it to get influenced by the big funds.

&#x200B;

Stock price at various Market capitalization visualization.

₹32 - 8.6k crore

₹64 - 17.2k crore

₹96 - 25.8k crore

₹128 - 34.4crore

₹160 - 43k crore

&#x200B;

This is a highly scalable data-driven business with very low risk of lending. Like, you know exactly what a solar panel will cost, and how much money it will produce over the years, so you are unlikely to give bad loans. In other financing companies, the risk is high like if you give loans to an airline or for making an ebike manufacturing factory, or give out personal loans, data is not the same for each loan-taker even in same industry. So, it is possible one ebike company makes profit while other do not. But that is not the case with solar or wind energy.

In one way I am happy I am getting to buy this stock at undervalued prices, but I am also mad at the government for selling 25% stake in such a profit making good company for loot prices. They could have got full subscription even at double the price. So, why sell low?

In general, this looks like a very good stock for long term value investing. There are so many upsides but very little downsides. I am going for long in this one.

Read my Take first before any negetive comments :

# Hyundai Motor IPO

# Final Decision & Review⏬

May apply for Long term & Listing gain would be in range of 10% or lesser I feel so safe investors may stay away if any bad situation arise on listing day

▶️Hyundai is 2nd largest car mfg in india with 14% market share

Company is well established in India & it's well known brand in India as well World wide

Hyundai have 1,377 sales outlets & 1,561 service outlets across India

▶️Hyundai's Portfolio :

Sedans: Aura, Verna

Hatchbacks: Grand i10 NIOS, i20, i20 N Line

SUVs: Exter, Venue, Venue N Line, Creta, Creta N Line,Alcazar, Tucson, IONIQ 5

▶️Hyundai India serves Domastic as well as international markets like Africa , Nepal ,Latin America etc

▶️Revenue mix

Domestic : 76%

Exports : 24%

▶️ Strong Positives :



Excellent Anchor book & Huge demand from World's Fund Houses

2. HMI is Well Established in India since 1996

3. Strong parentage of Hyundai Group,Korea

4. Hyundai cars are more Premium & Sturdy than Maruti's so it has unique & better customer base

Plus with growing income per head , citizens will prefer more premium cars

Negetives :



Hyundai Group Took out huge ₹ 15,435 Cr cash as dividend

2. Revenue growth \~5%

3. Valuation inline with peer not cheaper

'Overall company looks Excellent'

It's Highly Profitable & Deep rooted brand in India

It's Better than loss making auto companies Like Ola , Aether etc

Plus they are launching EV version of the Bestselling car ""Creta"" soon so sales could drive up so Good company for Long Term , Short term will be decided based on fund house's demand...

Note : I applied more than this quantities in mankind IPO where everyone was negetive but I sold with 30% profit in few weeks after listing

Same goes with Vodafone FPO , first cry IPOs

Such Good Quality company's subscribed IPOs only give good opportunity to Earn significant gain in short to long term.

I have capacity to bear losses too and as I earned Good in such IPOs and my investment style is different and risky , no one should follow me and take their investments decesion wisely.

People are buying Simens , ABB ,Trent at 100+ PE while Hyundai coming at only 26.5 PE

Don't be too negetive on quality companies.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Dear Community, Boycott OLA IPO #BoycottOlaIPO Ola IPO: A Risky Bet on a Company Built on Sand

Ola, the once-promising Indian startup, is on the brink of an IPO. But is this a golden opportunity or a ticking time bomb? A closer look at the company's history reveals a disturbing pattern of shifting focus, questionable business practices, and a troubling lack of financial sustainability. 

A Chameleon of a Company:
Ola, under the leadership of Bhavish Aggarwal, has been anything but consistent. From ride-sharing to electric vehicles, AI, and maps, the company has jumped from one shiny object to the next. This lack of focus is a red flag for any investor. 

EVs: A Rebranded Foreign Product: Ola's electric scooters, touted as a revolutionary product, are essentially rebranded versions of Netherlands-based scooters. This raises serious questions about the company's innovation and manufacturing capabilities.
Maps: A Copycat Service: Ola Maps is nothing more than a rebranded OpenStreetMaps, a free, open-source platform. Again, this raises concerns about originality and value creation.
AI: ChatGPT Integration: Ola's AI ambitions seem to rely heavily on integrating ChatGPT, another third-party service. This raises doubts about the company's ability to develop its own AI technology.

A House of Cards
Ola's business model appears to be built on a shaky foundation. The company has consistently burned through cash, and its revenue generation model remains unclear. By simply slapping its logo on third-party products and services, Ola seems more interested in quick wins than sustainable growth.
Investors Beware
Before investing in Ola's IPO, potential investors should carefully examine the company's financials, track record, and business model. The risks associated with this investment are substantial. Ola's history of inconsistent performance, reliance on third-party technology, and lack of profitability raise serious concerns about the company's long-term viability. 
It's time for investors to ask tough questions: Is Ola a genuine innovator or a master of disguise? Can the company sustain its growth without resorting to questionable business practices? And most importantly, is this IPO a golden opportunity or a trap?
Let's protect our hard-earned money. Boycott the Ola IPO.",1722527542.0,551,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ehk3k0/dear_community_boycott_ola_ipo_boycottolaipo/
Reddit,urban company ipo,"Paytm announces its IPO, here is how a loss making company plans to do that There is a provision through which a loss making company can do an IPO but with few changes.

For a normal company (profit making, networth clauses, etc), when IPO is issued, the allocation reservations to various investor classes is:
QIBs - 50%
HNIs - 15%
Retail - 35%
(ignoring the employees / parent company shareholder quota for the moment).

When a loss making company goes for an IPO, the allocation changes to
QIBs - 75%
HNIs - 15%
Retail - 10%

Basically, 25% retail goes out to QIBs. Of course SEBI wants to protect retail investors 😄

So, getting allocation is going to be more difficult for you for new age IPOs like PayTms and other loss making ones which will follow, if you are a retail investor.

 SEBI is also planning to make few of these IPOs only for Insti guys. Work in progress.

2. Other large size peers like LIC Housing, PNB Housing, Canfin Housing are available at P/B 1.3-2.7x.
3. Smaller players like Aadhar, Aavas, Aptus and Home Finance are available at range of 3.3x to 4.8x.
4. Last 3 years growth - AUM growth of 31% CAGR over FY22-24 with 56% PAT CAGR
5. BHFL has lowest GNPA & NNPA in the industry (best asset quality)

So, considering all parameters - its presence in housing finance & other financing space, its superior growth, and best operational metrics along with Top class proven Promoters - BHFL will attract Premium Valuations.

Listing Price View - As per current GMP  it is likely to List around 100% Gains i.e., Rs. 140-150 range vs issue price of Rs. 70/-.

With such listing, it will be available at P/B of above 6x. Leaves limited upside growth.

Sell on Listing - Price above Rs. 130-140

Hold on Listing - Incase of bad listing with 30-60%.

Fresh Buying - Only below Rs. 100-110 range or else I will wait for market to settle down & wait for price discovery because after a good listing gains, hardly any immediate upside is left.

Even though it's a good company, no point in FOMO. Rather I will now focus on other Housing finance company to see if any re-rating possible in other players.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Rajkot collapsed Hyundai IPO I always wanted to get into Gujarati circles to know more about stock investing but seeing the level of stock market involvement in Gujarat has piqued my interest even more.

Rajkot, a tier-2 city in Gujarat, wrote the fate of India's biggest IPO to date.

Interestingly, Rajkot is India's third-largest source of IPO applications. This is comparable to the level of involvement seen in a city as big as Mumbai (the financial capital of India), despite having only 10% of Mumbai's population.

But that is not all. Rajkot also has a high participation through the grey market, which has influenced Hyundai's GMP. GMP is the number #1 factor that retail investors take into account before applying for an IPO.

Companies make a sales pitch of their IPOs (through roadshows) to potential investors, brokers, and media houses to create hype. The roadshow circuits of IPO-bound companies focus on big cities, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, and a small, seemingly ""out of place"" city Rajkot.

But this seemingly ""out of place"" city has to show interest in the grey market for the GMP to go up, thereby deciding the outcome of the IPO.

Investors of Rajkot did not show much interest in the Hyundai IPO. The city, with its stock market culture and seasoned share brokers, is an important hub for the IPO grey market. Rajkot was supposedly a big IPO hub even back in the 1990s. Hyundai Motors GMP tanked day by day and a large part of this is due to disinterest from the city having the third-highest number of IPO applicants.

In contrast, investors from the city showed interest in Waaree Energies IPO and the GMP went up by crazy margins. Surprising right? That investors from a tier-2 city can influence retail investors throughout the country when they decide not to invest in a particular IPO.

Now after this observation, I remember my hunch about the Hyundai IPO GMP deliberately being bought down so that some large players can buy a fundamentally good company at a cheap valuation (by reducing competition during IPO). But my theory might also have some loopholes since this was only a casual observation.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"IFCI owns ₹13,000 Cr worth of NSE stock - but trades at ₹64. This could be India's biggest value unlock story. Most people think of IFCI Ltd as a dusty PSU relic. But here’s what the market is missing - and why it might be the deepest value play on the NSE IPO. Recent article on MoneyControl (https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ifci-s-buried-treasure-the-rs-25-000-crore-stake-in-nse-could-change-its-fate-13211734.html) got me thinking..

**The Hidden Goldmine:**

* IFCI owns 52.86% of SHCIL (Stock Holding Corporation of India)
* SHCIL owns 11 crore shares in NSE = 4.444% stake
* NSE unlisted valuation = **₹2,285/share** → Market cap \~₹5.65 lakh crore
* IFCI’s effective stake in NSE = 2.3493% → worth ₹13,286 crore

**Per Share Impact:**

* IFCI has 269.4 crore shares outstanding
* NSE stake alone is worth ₹49.31 per share
* Current share price = ₹63.98 (02/07/2025 closing)
* **NSE holding accounts for 77% of IFCI’s current value**

**Total Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Intrinsic Value = ₹62.49/share:**

* ₹49.31 – Indirect NSE stake
* ₹8.72 – Value from SHCIL’s own operations
* ₹4.46 – Net asset value from IFCI’s own book

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* NSE IPO expected in FY26
* Government-approved merger of SHCIL into IFCI
* ₹500 crore capital infusion from Government of India
* Monetisation of stake or direct listing could crystallise hidden value

**Why It’s Not Priced In Yet:**

* Legacy NPA baggage and weak lending book
* PSU label and governance inertia
* Market has not fully accounted for indirect asset holding

**The Opportunity:**  
This isn’t an earnings turnaround story - it’s a holding company trading well below the value of its assets. If either the NSE IPO or SHCIL merger executes, IFCI could be re-rated significantly.

**My Conclusion:**  Downside is **protected near ₹60–62**, due to strong asset backing; Long-term re-rating possible if IFCI transforms from legacy lender to a focused asset-holding entity

Is this just another forgotten PSU, or the best value bet in India’s financial sector?

🔸 Sharp increase in royalty payment percentage to the parent, also just before IPO. 

🔸 Launching IPO with full of face component at Big Bull market valuations, while automotive market is struggling.

🔸 Over valued IPO.

🔸 Hyundai sale is decreasing by 5% in July.

🔸 Pear companies are undervalued and with lower P/E ratio like Tata Motors. 

🔸 This is historically big IPO, so supplies huge. So slow chance of listing gain.

🔸 It may fall sharp after listing.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Sharing a (long term) success story Hello all, I am sharing a long term (by rough estimate of 34 years) success story. What you see in the picture is a our family's stock portfolio. I could have given a screenshot of broker but they are just so spread out. 



By our estimate, my father doesn't know for sure, the beginging of the pf goes back to 1990, and we have some securities since then. My father did good that he understood the potential of it, when others around him didn't. How he got started is that he used to work in bank, and folks used to come to banks to get demand draft in 90s when applying for IPO (how things have changed!!) and he along with other members of staff also used to apply to few, the only difference was that if got allotted, my fathers colleague used to sell to get listing gains, and he used to just hang on to them. And, with time he got himself more educated, we still get ""Dalal street investment Journal"" since late 90s. Though, he never invested in mutual funds, which i am still unable to understand. In my 12th grade, i supplied whole class of 25 students of commerce section with annual reports, and when i was a kid i always used to judge companies by quality of their annual reports, and colgate was the most finely printed. 



Was my father an ""educated"" investor, probably not, if you throw words like EPS, bull, bear, correction, pullback, EBIDTA, half of the word he would not understand, let alone answer them, but what he subconsciously knew was his strength which was limited activity, he has never really sold any shares because ""price was down"", if you ask me have beaten the market (TWRR or IRR), i can't answer that, but what i can answer is that we have created a sizable corpus of securities which all the people in our social group has not, and this is simple long term effect of compounding. 



Some points

-We would be what you call as active-passive investor, we have investment in every kind, Mutual funds, index funds, stocks public and private, india and outside. 



-Since time immorial we have applied to IPOs and we have some failures and some spectuacular successes. Some IPO successes are HDFC, Genus Power (no one knew of this until 2 years and we held thru all the ""dark"" days), Divis, Dmart. Recent ones are Kaynes, Zomato, and most recent in Bajaj Housing finance. And, we not sold a single one of them, they may die on us but haven't sold. 



-Some failures, one in particular comes to mind is golden forest based out of Chandigarh which later turned out to be a ponzi scheme, and then there is YesBank, some sucking IPOs are paytm and CapitalSFB. 



-We have held some stocks so long that we don't know what the purchase date is or purchase price, reliance (went thru whole emotional cycle of Dhiru dying, brothers quarrel, ADAG and Jio, and now expected division into 3 companies), Colgate, LT, Videocon, which we was high flyer and then went private (Nayara) but we have held thru it. 



-For good or bad, we have always considered this PF as something which is like family ""darohar"" something which has to be passed onto generations, and we treat it like that, something to be not messed up. 



I am not saying this is best method or the only method, I am saying this is a method which we, in my opinion have achieved success. As they say play your own game. 



I'll end with a comment my father makes when we talk about frequent downturns in stocks ""'my name"" abhi to 1st inning hai, game ka result to 5th day ko pata chalega"". We have never graduated from 1st inning. 



If you have any questions feel free.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Hyundai IPO closes on an underwhelming note Media houses were frantically pushing the narrative, ""Apply for Hyundai IPO"" even though retail subscription is low and GMP is coming down to zero (reportedly GMP went as low as ₹-33). It's also being hyped as the ""largest successful IPO in India""

But the cold truth is the IPO was overpriced (similar to LIC, in fact even worse) and retail subscription was only 50%.

Financially strong company, brand reputation, global player. None of it mattered since the company did not make it clear if the proceeds will be invested in Indian arm of the company and people can only assume where will their money go once the South Korean promoters pocket it.

Retail investors might have seen only the GMP without seeing the other factors mentioned above but they have indeed saved themselves from the disappointment when the listing happens and see their holdings in red.

Also anyway mutual fund houses would have indirectly deployed retailers money in the IPO, which was unavoidable.

But I'm also getting a hunch that the GMP has deliberately been bought down so that some large players can buy a fundamentally good company at a cheap valuation.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Hyundai IPO is filled with red flags A lot of you are excited about the biggest IPO in India till date. Biggest IPO also means higher chances of allotment.

But is that all?

This IPO has a lot of red flags that cannot be ignored.

First red flag is that issue is 0% fresh issue and 100% offer for sale.

Means that none of the IPO money goes to the Indian arm of the company. 

Yes, you read it right. The money goes to the South Korean promoters which effectively means that promoters are reducing their holdings. Or they want to mint money from the IPO frenzy in India.

This brings us to the second red flag. After the issue, the shareholding changes from 100% promoter holding to 82.5% promoter holding. But wait that's not it. 

According to the amendment to the Securities Contracts Regulation Rules by SEBI in 2010, promoters of listed Indian companies (other than PSU companies) holding more than 75% had to compulsorily sell their additional holdings to bring it down to maximum 75%.

This means that, 7.5% more promoter holding has to be reduced within 3 years of listing. What does this bring us to?

A 7.5% OFS in the next 3 years which might cause the share price to drop even more

Third red flag is the low cash reserves in the company and even worse, increase in dividend payout to the parent company by taking money out of cash reserves. AFTER THE IPO! Wait what!? So this also means we cannot expect the company to issue a fair amount of dividends!

Fourth red flag is that the grey market premium (GMP) is tanking badly and is at a miniscule Rs. 65/share. Remember that the share price will fall further due to selling that happens after the listing.

Some positives are low debt, the car sales number in India and their market share but valuation is equally important if not more. 

Which is why it would be wise to wait for the right valuation to enter for the long-term.",1728939683.0,381,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g3qobl/hyundai_ipo_is_filled_with_red_flags/

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**  
  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  


**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.

Recently, taxes on auto companies were reduced, which means better profits for them. This tax cut could give Hero Motors an extra push and make the IPO more attractive to investors.

Still, it will be important to see how Hero Motors performs against other big auto and EV players. But with strong demand in the sector and the tax benefit, this IPO might get good response from the market.",1758008293.0,145,https://i.redd.it/x06gqz31dhpf1.png
Reddit,urban company ipo,"Is Jio price Hike fair? And does it make it a monopoly? EDIT: It’s a pro Jio post and got hate because people assumed it’s a hate post and didn’t even read. I tried to give a different POV from the other Jio monopoly posts (generic stuff about how you’re the product if it’s free) 
Will delete the post. But could’ve read more than just the title and commenting on that basis.

I’m just trying to bring a different POV. I might be wrong, happy to learn!

We all look at Jio and call it a monopoly business model, where eventually they’ll get all the users hooked to their service and have no other option available.

1. Bur what exactly will keep us hooked to Jio? 
Service and pricing, if that deteriorates people will switch. Unlike google and Facebook that are irreplaceable because they are the product itself. Jio is just a service provider. 

2. telecom is a very capital intensive industry. 
Look around the globe, all major economies have 3-4 major internet providers like India.
Germany, USA, Australia, Korea, Japan, UK. 
And hence our internet penetration only grew by 1.5% from 2011 to 2018 and then by 6-8% each year.
And consolidation is essential for internet to be accessible for all. Because prior to Jios entry we had 7-8 major players.
Result no economy of scale hence Internet was still accessible in urban areas mostly.
(Where most of the reddit users come from )

3. Jio and others hiked prices after 3 years, adjusted for inflation most plans are at the same cost and they have put immense capital for 5G

4. India still has one of the lowest if not the lowest per gb cost, one month plan is still less than 10 rs per GB
Pre jio it was 250 rs per GB so even if they increase prices by 2000% it’ll be still cheaper than what people paid back in 2017 not even adjusted for inflation.

5. Without jios entry
- No UPI
- No gaming companies
- no e-commerce and quick commerce penetration 
- no viable market for social media in India
- no UPI based companies
- Insanely difficult WFH during COVID 
- No Product managers, Programmatic managers, Business Analyst, Developers insane salary growth and requirement in the market.
- no OTT
- No music streaming 

Basically no user level data.

Jio has democratised knowledge and learning, has made technology accessible to remotest part of INDIA.

Sure the Govt helped Jio and Ambani initially but they also made sure not to let VI go completely bust by converting debt to equity without voting rights, making sure to not convert VI to another BSNL and PSU.
If we have 3-4 players in the market, we should be fine just like the rest of the world.

I think we forget what it was like prior to 2017 and how I used to switch 2G to check WhatsApp messages and never watched a video on YouTube without making sure it wasn’t running on anything above 360p
And now I don’t care if it’s 720p or 1080p

Now we get connectivity even during complete train and bus journeys. 
No need to keep things downloaded for journeys (expect air travel)

Reddit,urban company ipo,"SEBI NSE deal is a blatant loot of retailers NSE has proposed 1400 crore  settlement with SEBI to shut all investigations against it for richest India Inc's [ 62(?) stock brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) priority preferential colocation - private colocation = 10 lakh per rack per year,  and dark fibre connections providing early access, thus failing to provide equitable access to all its trading members thereby trying to whitewash the biggest government assisted fraud - Scam 2010 ( may be next sequel ) - in Indian history which produced unworthy billionaires at cost of gullible retailers, using one or more leased line from any of the four service providers - MTNL, TATA, Reliance and Bharti and one unauthorized Sampark Infotainment - NSE/MEM/12985 to facilitate better access to Direct Market Access (DMA) and algorithmic trading..... in 2009-10!

The scale of this settlement reveals the enormous profits generated through privileged order flow access, early order detection and front-running capabilities granted to a handful of players. Many Nifty 50 companies' liquidity appears sustained by capital accumulated through these questionable practices over the past decade, while retail investors bore the costs through [brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) that facilitated this unequal system.

With only token actions taken against CNBC/ET Now tipster Gift City based IIFL Securities' director Sanjiv Bhasin or index banks like IndusInd Bank, ICICI , RHFL etc ( a long list ) this precedent risks further entrenching the advantage of sophisticated algorithmic traders (like Jane Street's GPU-based systems), potentially eliminating any remaining non-algo participants.

Instead of permitting alleged manipulation profits to remain concentrated among privileged market players, shouldn't regulatory mechanisms be established to compensate defrauded traders? This could take the form of direct restitution or tax relief measures - rather than continuing a system that has disproportionately benefited select entities for decades.

The current settlement attempts to whitewash what may represent one of India's most significant financial scandals - one that has enriched both corporate and political interests through systematic market advantages. Now, these same patterns risk being perpetuated through new AI-driven trading systems that provide even greater opacity and deniability.

This raises fundamental questions about our judicial system's ability to address such complex financial crimes in a timely manner - whether examining the 7-year deliberation on electoral bonds, Justice Varma's proceedings, or the stalled Boeing investigations. The systemic delays and loopholes suggest institutional frameworks remain ill-equipped to confront modern financial engineering, leaving retail investors perpetually vulnerable.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Kalyan jewellers - a overhated but interesting stock Before I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news 

Over the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) 

The allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered 


Now you may say ""you are biased cause you hold it"" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait


Now onto the allegations -

1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way

2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false

3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars

4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos 😂 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case

5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange 


The overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market 


About corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class
The chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me

It's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest



This also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab
Polycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis 
I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG
Now the rest readers can take it as it may
I haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it

I remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say ""don't compare it to titan"" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims
Data doesn't lie nor does factual information,
 Good luck investing and take care",1737178172.0,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i40mpb/kalyan_jewellers_a_overhated_but_interesting_stock/
Reddit,urban company ipo,"Hyundai IPO: The other side Hello Everyone. I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter here about why you shouldn’t jump on the Hyundai India IPO, and while some points are valid, I want to share another side of the story. Not saying you should or shouldn't invest—**just clearing up some misconceptions and dropping some data to show you the other-side.**

**This IPO is not without problems I'm sure you must have seen problems on this sub already. THIS POST WILL LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.**

# Hyundai India's PE Ratio Vs Hyundai Korea's PE Ratio

One common gripe is Hyundai India’s PE ratio is around 25 versus Hyundai Korea’s \~5. Yeah, that's true, but it misses the bigger picture. Check out these other companies:

|Indian Company|Indian Company's PE|Foreign Company|Foreign Company's PE|Ratio between PEs|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|73|Nestle SA|19|3.84|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|63|Unilever PLC|22|2.86|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|29|Suzuki Motor Corp|9.5|2.7|
|BASF India|54.5|BASF SE|12.5|4.36|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|70|GSK plc|15|4.66|

Notice a trend? Indian subsidiaries usually trade at a premium. It’s because India’s seen as a high-growth market, and the free float (how many shares are available for trading) is typically lower, pushing up the PE.

We can do the same comparing Revenue to Market cap also.

|Indian Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|Foreign Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|2.32|28.27|Nestle SA|111.03|250.50|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|7.35|77.84|Unilever plc|58.20|157.06|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|16.56|46.38|Suzuki Motor Corp|36.60|19.87|
|BASF India|1.72|4.28|BASF SE|70.43|44.73|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|0.4|5.4|GSK plc|39.46|79.54|
|Hyundai India|8.3|19|Hyundai Motor Co|125.35|44.86|

This data honestly surprised me too. Suzuki Motor Corp holds 58% of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. This suggests that the rest of Suzuki Motor Corp is actually negatively valued. And yes the Revenue being more than the market cap for some companies is not a mistake. This just goes to show the discrepancy between the foreign and Indian share markets.

My point here is that the Indian company will **ALWAYS** seem overvalued compared to their foreign parents. Even if you were to dig deeper like I did with the Suzuki Example, you will realise that the market cap for the foreign company seems to be disproportionately coming from the Indian company which would be listed as an Asset on their books.

# Comparing PE/Valuation with Competition

|Company|Market Cap (Cr INR)|Revenue (Cr INR)|PE Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Maruti Suzuki|3,91,000|1,46,000|29.01|
|Mahindra and Mahindra|3,78,000|1,42,000|33.56|
|Tata Motors|3,37,000|4,44,000|10.75|
|Hyundai India|1,59,258|71,302|**\~26.5**|

So, the PE ratios for Hyundai India is actually less than Maruti and Mahindra. It's market cap to revenue ratio is also lower than Maruti and Mahindra. Tata motors is the exception here since they do operate in more sectors.

Now I know that you should not judge stocks solely based on PEs, but this provides a quick overview as to where Hyundai India stands. You and dig deep through their books and you will find that everything seems to be inline with their peers.

Even their Market Cap to Revenue is inline with Maruti and Mahindra.

# Index Inclusion: Why It Matters

Hyundai India is set to be included in major stock indexes (Nifty 100, Nifty 500, Possibly Nifty Next 50) within the next 6 months. Once it’s in the indexes, lots of passive funds will automatically buy it, increasing demand and potentially driving up the price.

At IPO, Hyundai India’s market cap will be similar to big players like Punjab National Bank or Adani Energy Solutions. Even 2-3% of shares going to index funds can mean around 10% of total free float shares getting snapped up. The actively managed funds will also want to buy Hyundai India since it’s now part of their benchmark Index, boosting demand even more.

# The Offer for Sale (OFS)

I have to say that the OFS offering has lead to some South Korean hate on this sub. This is insane and should not be happening. Hyundai came into India, set up a subsidiary, manufacturing and genuine created value. And even if their actions are ""Greedy"", that is just one company. It's insane to see this hate being directed at South Korea as a whole.

So what's exactly happening: Hyundai Korea is selling shares, not Hyundai India. They **claim** to need funds for R&D which happens at the Parent company while Hyundai India is only for Manufacturing. This IPO lets them get cash without Hyundai having to take on debt or dilute its equity.

**Hyundai Korea still holds a majority after the IPO, so they’re not just exiting.** They’re still invested and running the show, ensuring that the company has the backing it needs for future growth. They very much still have skin in the game. OFS is actually not that uncommon when you look at it. The Indian company's financials are healthy and it simply doesn't need a cash injection at this point.

# The Dividend

Pre-IPO dividends can sound sketchy, but they’re actually pretty common. Look at Indigo—they did the same thing. Hyundai India is using its generated cash to pay dividends, which should be factored into your valuation calculations. This can actually boost ROE by reducing excess equity, making the company look more efficient.

NB: Came across this research which explains in more detail why Pre-IPO dividend is not as bad as you think [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664)

# The IPO will be undersubscribed

Well- Data suggests otherwise. The IPO is already over 40% subscribed. As of writing this post, DIIs (Domestic Mutual Funds and AMCs) have still NOT placed their Bids (They usually come in on the last day). The IPO has similar subscription to Paytm (and other IPOs this size) after 2 days. Given the trends in past IPO subscriptions, it is fair to assume this IPO will be full subscribed and may be oversubscribed by up to 2x.

Even if it doesn't hit 3-4x oversubscription, filling up the subscription is still a win, especially since Hyundai is raising a massive $3.3 billion USD.

(NB: If you want to check this data for yourself, head over to: [https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active](https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active) then click Bid details and select ""Consolidated Bids"". Make sure you are not only looking at the NSE Bids.)

# Grey Market Premium (GMP)

Even though GMP has dropped, it never went below zero. It has always stayed a premium and never became a discount. This shows steady interest and suggests the IPO is priced fairly—not overpriced or underpriced.

Unlike many IPOs that rely on discounts to attract buyers, Hyundai’s valuation means the listing price should align closely with the offer price, reflecting true value. If you only apply to IPOs for listing gains- This isn't an IPO for you.

# A side note

One of the biggest issues with the Indian stock market is that the Breath of the market is not increasing as fast as the Depth. More and more capital is pouring in but the number of large companies isn't increasing at the same speed. Given the IPOs that have been coming out at such a huge discount recently all giving amazing listing gains, I could imagine why this is a turn off that Hyundai decided to list themselves at fair market value. But IPOs aren't meant for a listing gain. They are to take a company public, which this one seems to be successful in doing.

# --- Edit ---

**Appreciate all the feedback. Someone even texted me and called me Mr. Hyundai Man which I found hilarious. A few common points I missed seem to be brought up by multiple people, so I wanted to address these.**

# The Royalty

So, yes. There is a Royalty.

But guess what? Every foreign company with an Indian subsidiary does this. Why? Are they trying to loot India? No. This is the payment for maintaining the brand. Any spend Hyundai Korea does to polish the Hyundai brand benefits Hyundai India and this is the payment for that. The royalty is capped at 5%. This isn't anything insane and many other MNCs - including Toyota India (which is currently private), Bosch, Schaeffler India and Wabco India - pay royalty payments to their parent companies. A couple interesting ones are:

|Company|Cap on Royalty to Parent for Brand|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India|4.5%|They tried to increase it recently but the shareholders rejected the resolution.|
|Maruti Suzuki|5%||

Now, the Cap doesn't always mean this much money will be payed out. In FY23, Maruti paid 3.75% royalty to Suzuki motors. At one point in time, the royalty used to be above 6-6.5% before coming down to the 5% cap now in place. So, I ask you this-

**If Maruti Suzuki has a 5% royalty, why is Hyundai India's 5% not justified? I would argue that ""Maruti"" has a brand value within India which may be sustainable without Suzuki. Hyundai is Hyundai and without the name, it has no alternative.**

Hyundai India benefits much more from this royalty deal than Maruti Suzuki does. Yet for some reason, people think Hyundai is ""Greedy"" and Suzuki are Saints.

# Mini IPO? 75% promoter shareholding rule

Someone in the comments said ""the parent company has to offload an additional 7.5% stake in the coming six months to reach the max 75% promoter holding"". This is partly true that 7.5% additional stake needs to be offloaded but not in the next 6 months. This will take place in 3-5 years ([Source](https://www.autocarpro.in/news/hyundai-india-to-dilute-75-additional-stake-in-3-5-years-122999)). This would be 1-2% additional free float every year something the markets can easily handle while increasing liquidity for the stock (speculation alert) potentially propelling Hyundai India into the F&O Category.

It is in **Hyundai's best interest to do this as slowly as possible too**. If they were to crash the price of the Indian subsidiary, Hyundai Korea's books would show fewer assets. To keep their own book inflated, they will make sure this happens responsibly. **They aren't selling and running away, they will still own 75% of the company.**

# So you are actually saying Hyundai India is a Buy?

Absolutely NOT. The purpose of this post is not to tell you to buy or not. It was to show the facts. The decision to BUY is yours. People seemed to have reached the conclusion that Hyundai is Bad with incomplete facts.

It is funny how people have a problem with things from Royalty to Valuation. Funny part is, from the looks of it, Hyundai India tried to copy Maruti Suzuki. And this makes sense! They are following a very similar business model here. In fact, Suzuki Motors is much worse of without Maruti Suzuki compared to Hyundai Korea without Hyundai India.

THIS TYPE OF DELIVERY BASE BUYING MEANS THE PUBLIC HOLDING FURTHER GO DOWN FROM LAST QTR ITS ALREADY DOWN FROM 5.53% TO 5.36%, ITS MAY BE POSSIBLE THIS BUYING DUE TO CONTINUE POSITIVE FACTOR LIKE MONSOON, INFLATION, CRUDE OIL DOWN, RURAL DEMAND ON UP AND URBAN DEMAND ON ALSO UPSIDE .

Dabur India has several positive factors in 2025, including its strong brand reputation, robust distribution network, and ongoing focus on innovation and premiumization. Specifically, the company is benefiting from rising in-home cooking trends, the increasing demand for Ayurvedic and natural products, and the expansion of its online presence. 

Positive Factors for Dabur India in 2025:

Dabur India's long-standing presence and association with traditional Ayurvedic practices have built a strong and trusted brand image. 

\*   TURNAROUND FACTORS FOR FULL YEAR 2025:

CRUDE  OIL – DOWN SO COST OF TRANSPORTATION GO DOWN

INFLATION – INFLATION DOWN IN COMPARE TO LAST YEAR GIVE MORE MONEY IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMER SO SALES FURTHER INCREASE.

MONSOON – THE EARLY MONSOON AND REMAIN GOOD SO IT ALSO POSITIVE TO FIND THE RAW MATERIAL ON LOWER PRICE.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Hyundai IPO last-minute TLDR Keeping this short since people don't read entirely and comment according to what they choose to read.

The GMP is now around 1% of the IPO band price, so you would have an idea of what to do in this IPO.

Now coming to the long-term perspective instead of IPO:

1. Good market share and largest exporter of passenger cars from India.

2. Potential to benefit from growing car ownership in India

3. Car sales down in the short-term and if profitability is managed well, Hyundai Motors can grow well in the long-term.

4. Increasing net-profits and revenue.

5. Royalty to parent company up from 2% to 3.5%. Comparing Hyundai to Maruti Suzuki in this aspect is not a good idea since Maruti can de-merge from their parent company and still do well.

Not talking about other red flags since people are defending Hyundai for some reason.

Reasons to wait until listing and to NOT apply for IPO:

1. GMP down really bad and the listing will happen at a discounted price.

2. Even if the listing happens at a good premium, by some miracle, the IPO size is huge and the selloff to book profits will be MASSIVE leading to the share price coming down and being volatile.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Additional Resources for Fundamental Analysis! **Precursor:** *In this post, I’ll mention some lesser-known resources that I find really useful and that can help you further in your fundamental research. Let’s jump straight into it.*

**1. Tijori Finance:**

I primarily use **Screener**, but **Tijori Finance** provides data that isn’t as easily accessible on Screener.in.

**For example:**

https://preview.redd.it/nmfloulooynd1.jpg?width=1765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77aca7b827d9d8ed80e23d889a5d68b38d501be9

Take **Polycab**—Tijori Finance shows the **product mix**, **export percentages** to different regions, and sometimes even the **distribution channels**. The product mix is especially helpful if you want to quickly discover what contributes the most revenue for the company and then dive deeper from there.

https://preview.redd.it/zdrevr2roynd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=d552db45f81b6fa5ea0a83e89ffb73e4a294de61

In some cases, Tijori even shows the market share of a company. While I’d recommend double-checking the data with other sources, it helps give you a rough idea of where the company stands.

[Screener.in](http://Screener.in) only shows segmental revenue to paid users. For product mix, you can check the company’s latest presentation or annual report, but Tijori Finance offers a quicker option.

https://preview.redd.it/2dplwt1xoynd1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4cc76868d3de62254f141c58894e4760a01f32

Another feature I appreciate in Tijori is the list of links to various articles and videos relevant to the company, right at the bottom of the page.

**2. DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus):**

If you’re not familiar, a **DRHP** is an offer document issued by a company and submitted to SEBI before it goes public. Even though I don’t invest in IPOs, I enjoy reading DRHPs of companies going public because they offer valuable insights into specific industries..

For instance, in the DRHP of **Hyundai**, if you navigate to the ***Industry Overview*** section from the table of contents,

https://preview.redd.it/eb1x6yiyoynd1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce7821e8375278864ebce06b60ae208804fc390

You can get great insights of the **automobile industry**, including market shares and growth trends, to understand the industry's dynamics. You can find the latest [DRHPs here.](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=3&ssid=15&smid=11)

Another helpful resource for sector research is **Motilal Oswal’s sectoral research reports**

https://preview.redd.it/z548l2ozoynd1.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ddb9ea4605652fd3ef3ffbe263620a3690b8ff

Motilal Oswal's website, Research 360, provides up-to-date [sector reports](https://www.research360.in/research-report/sector-report) on industries like financials, hotels, and insurance, offering the latest updates.

[Ibef.org](http://Ibef.org) is another website by ministry of commerce which offers great sectoral insights.

**3. Credit Ratings:**

**Credit ratings** are an underrated resource that can significantly enhance your fundamental research. These reports often contain information that’s hard to find elsewhere.

For example, when I was researching **Eimco Elecon**, a capital goods company that makes underground mining equipment, the credit report gave me a critical insight.

[Eimco Elecon Credit Report](https://preview.redd.it/c8jva6qgpynd1.jpg?width=1038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f9bc6e95df8c93426be2a8496edbc049ed1bd53)

It revealed that the company enjoys a **near-monopoly** in the underground mining equipment segment, with **Coal India as its biggest customer**. That was something I hadn’t come across in other sources and was a key piece of information.

[Lotus Chocolate Company Credit Report](https://preview.redd.it/hdi2samjpynd1.jpg?width=967&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba943cee3c75e494484e52abfffa3d37f19a7ac)

At first glance, the **outrageous valuation** and frequent **upper circuits** were clear red flags. Nonetheless, I wanted to know what the company does. The credit report for **Lotus Chocolate** showed that it had notable **B2B clients** like **Amul** and **Mother Dairy**.

Overall, credit reports are a great resource for gaining deeper insights, especially for lesser-known companies

**4. ValuePickr:**

Many seasoned investors may already know about this one, but for those who don’t, **ValuePickr** is a forum of passionate investors who discuss various companies in dedicated threads.

[ValuePickr Forum](https://preview.redd.it/lx2gmj3spynd1.png?width=1527&format=png&auto=webp&s=569c65884661074c413d94b4133e6cd85e8f8371)

The site has an incredible wealth of information on different companies. Some of the threads go back 5 or even 10 years, and you can find **old annual reports, presentations, and discussions dating back** many years.

[Polycab's thread](https://preview.redd.it/8u93e66upynd1.jpg?width=1392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b47c157fc83b3b10c5048dfbe4ace0470c5ad35)

It’s an excellent tool if you want to track **the management’s execution** or learn more about a company. You might even discover companies that aren’t in the limelight yet.

I follow threads of the companies I'm invested in and **regularly** check for updates. It's one of my favorite resources for research, with knowledgeable investors sharing news and insights..

**To Conclude:** I can’t emphasize enough how crucial it is to review a company’s annual report, presentations, and transcripts as primary sources for fundamental research. That said, I wanted to highlight some additional resources that can offer further insights..

Hope this helps with your fundamental analysis! If you have any other tools to recommend, please share them in the comments below.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"NTPC Green Energy IPO analysis and verdict **1. Company fundamentals**

NTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:

**Strong Parentage:** Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.

**Company Growth:** NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from ₹910.42 crore in FY 2022 to ₹1,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from ₹94.74 crore in FY 2022 to ₹344.72 crore in FY 2024.

**Government Support:** The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.

2. **Issue size and split**

The size of the IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.

The NTPC Green Energy IPO is a **purely fresh issue**, meaning there is **no Offer For Sale (OFS)** component. This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.

3. **Brand name and experienced Management**

As mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.

The management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.

4. **Valuation**

NTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.

The company's PE ratio of 148 is higher than its smaller peers but is lesser than its bigger rival Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 260. The valuation is considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.

5. **Clear Use of Proceeds**

The company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.

While this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).

6. **Strong underwriting team**

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

The book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.

7. **QIB subscription**

When the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.

**Verdict**

This IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.",1731744514.0,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gsiqni/ntpc_green_energy_ipo_analysis_and_verdict/

Worth it right?

Let's also see the entire positives and negatives.

Positives:

1. Exponentially growing profits that grew more than 30 times in the last 4 years.

2. Reputed company with experienced management having more than 2 decades experience in the sector.

3. The company is at a fair valuation and about to list a PE of 33 compared to the Premier Energies which is trading at a PE of 123.

4. Solar energy sector is a rising sector with huge potential in the upcoming years and Waaree is already positioned as a leading player in the sector.

5. The company has made it clear that the proceeds from the IPO is about to be used mostly for a manufacturing facility with a capacity of 6GW

Negatives/risks:

1. India is dependent on China for solar cells and no manufacturing capacity for most of the raw materials and disruption in raw material supply or increase in pricing by Chinese companies can cause issues for the solar industry.

2. Domestic solar energy sector is dependent on government PLI schemes to run their businesses and any negative change (although highly unlikely) in the policies can impact the sector adversely.

3. Another company in the adjacent clean energy sector, MTAR Technologies, was highly dependant on Bloom Energy for it's business. When Bloom Energy's business dropped, MTAR's revenues also started falling. Although Waaree is not as concentrated in it's clients (48% of revenue is concentrated by top 5 customers), the risk needs to be reduced by diversifying significantly to other customers.

All the above mentioned risks are industry-specific risks and how it impacts the company is highly dependent on how the company handles these challenges. 

Waaree Energies is carrying out it's backward integration plan to to strengthen its supply chain, minimize costs and reduce dependence on China.",1729428293.0,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g7xuxn/waaree_energies_ipo_pros_and_cons/

Reddit,urban company ipo,"LG Electronics IPO - What do think LG IPO is something to study for.

A company with leading position , having superior RoNW and Higher EPS then peers should generally command a premium valuation and not 38 - 42% discounted valuation. The fact that book runners are pricing it so conservatively despite QIB Demand is a question of Fact that they are trying to garuntee a sucess and not monetize it.

When you closely observe the IPO

1. The Outflow ratio is 117%, on top of it they have extracted ₹ 45,817Cr in last 2 years, which is more then the IPO ask i.e. ₹ 11,607 cr


2. Parent Company's Global performance is struggling, the topline CAGR is 3% with collapsing margins, while Indian entity is growing at 28% PAT CAGR. This shows that parent entity is higly depenedn on Indian asset, On top of it  Indian entity contributes to 50% of LG Holdings dividend recieved from Electronics verticle.


3. LG Holding lost the equity value by 76% , and Electronics value lost is by 36%. So it needs a desperate proof to show a new value creation to its Korean Investors, and best way to create value addition is to tap and use capital market bull runs in india. there fore i assuem they wanted a 100% sucess in this IPO just to balance LG Holding equity value creation for Korean investors.



This are my assumptions based on the filed DHRP reports, but i am sure many news and other outlets have more insider informations then me. Then why didnt anyone covered this aspects?

This IPO narrative is created as under valued listing which it definetely is, but if you look from LG holdings / LG Electronics INC (Parent company) its clearly a distress sale with value creation as their main motive.

What are your thoughts on this.

   2. History - 30 trillion in 2020, 20 trillion in 2017, 10 trillion in 2014.
   3. This simply indicates more and more money is being poured into the market.
   4. So much so that for the first time DIIs have become equal/crossed FIIs in value in 2024.
3. As people put away their cautiousness and become greedy they get a sense of confidence and take bets in smaller and riskier companies. This is evident as we see smallcaps rise faster than mid and large caps.
   1. Small cap index is 6x since covid bottom whereas nifty is only 3.3x.
   2. Recent popularity of SME IPOs.
4. Finally the charts. These are created by dividing Smallcap and Midcap Indexes by Nifty Index (Below are cnxsmallcap/nifty50 and cnxmidcap/nifty50 respectively)

You can see last peak was in 2018 and we all know that from 2018 to 2020 there was a bear run in small caps (and mid too to some extent) - I will not attach these charts. Easy to look them up.

In last 20 years these channels have never been violated, but their boundaries have been clearly respected 5-6 times at least.

So I am of the opinion that this party is over especially in small and midcaps. It may be tomorrow or 6 months from now. Since these are month level charts so can take time. But one monthly reversal candle and it will all tumble. Even if nifty rises for next few years, small and mid caps cannot outperform nifty according to these charts.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"ATHER IPO What you need to know It’s really strange how ATHER is moving just weeks ahead of the much-awaited IPO. So much is not adding up 🙏🙏

And I am a tad bit nervous - What if there is more than what’s known to the public?

Let me explain in depth.

..

You see, Ather last raised funds at $1.3bn valuation in August 2024.

In September, it filed DRHP, aiming for a $0.5bn IPO (\~4K-4.5K Cr as per news reports). With markets starting to correct, it was reported that the target valuation had been scaled up to $2.4bn

But, markets corrected. Thus, the company is now set to list in May at a valuation of $1.2-1.3 bn. A steep drop.

\- However, what’s more important is that, the company is also said to have brought down the target valuation, yet again, by about 10% or so

\- Also, the funds to be raised have been slashed to Rs 3k crore vs Rs 4k crore before

Thus, if you think from the perspective of a potential incoming investor, a company facing so many issues with back-to-back cuts on valuation and the fundraise size so close to the IPO - This doesn’t look good.

Rather, the company is desperate to list as soon as possible. Of course, I can be wrong in my assessment. However, I believe that a company’s rush to list AT ANY COST does not inspire confidence.

..

Nobody knows for sure what’s the reason here. Though, one of the reasons is publicly known.

The company has been assured of rich incentives from Maharashtra Govt (nobody knows what), given they begin construction of the proposed new plant in Aurangabad in the committed timeline (again, nobody knows what).

\- For this, though, the company needs cash, which it is somewhat short on. Thus, either it needs to borrow or raise equity funding

\- And the company is aiming to use Rs 927 crore from the IPO proceeds for this

But, is that a big enough reason for the company to gulp down such drastic cuts to the valuation and list anyhow, because it would also dilute the shareholding of all shareholders significantly, including the founders who anyways now own a very small share.

Thus, as an individual, I am not able to understand how all of this adds up, unless there is more than what meets the eye - THE PUBLIC EYE.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"KRN Heat Exchanger (Plausible explanation for the 80% stock rise) Disclaimer: I do have a vested interest in posting this, I have invested quite a bit of my portfolio in KRN, I did this when my manpower staffing company had a discussion with their MD and CHRO but do hear me out.


1. What does KRN do?
KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Limited (KRN) specializes in manufacturing fin and tube type heat exchangers for the heat ventilation air 
conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) industry and their products are primarily made from non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminum. KRN 
customizes heat exchangers in various shapes and sizes to meet customer requirements and market demand with diameters ranging from 5 mm to 15.8 mm. 

2. Recent rise in stock price (manipulation or future expectations of strong profit growth):
KRN has given 80% returns since 1 month and has risen from 447 levels since Nov 5th and touched 800 levels yesterday.


3. A few possible reasons for this:

a. KRN is the only listed heat exchanger manufacturer and that gives investors a chance to get exposure to the HVAC & R components market

b. Q2 performance: The net profit for KRN Heat Exchanger grew 43% year on year at consolidated levels to ₹12.37 crore compared to ₹8.65 crore in the same quarter last year.

c. In their RHP for IPO they mentioned that the proceeds would fund their new manufacturing plant.
(Personal note if you choose to believe me: I work for a manpower staffing agency and we are in discussions with KRN's MD and CHRO for our support for their new plant with approx 2000+ temp and 500 perm workers.)

d. The above point suggests a strong order book that's evidenced by their client base who are mainly in the Air conditioners manufacturing industry including, including Daikin Air conditioning, Schnieder Electric IT Business India, Kirloskar Chillers, Blue Star, Climaventa Climate Technologies and Frigel Intelligent Cooling Systems India

e. In regards to the point above, temperatures around India have been rising due to various reasons with 2024 summer having recorded some serious health concerns around the country. We might be in for the same in 2025 and for the foreseeable future. 
In this case, KRN stands to benefit as demand for coolers will only grow and so will the orders from KRN's clients who are leading AC manufacturers.

f. Their products are also used as components in coolers across various industries like data centres, railways, automotive, defence, medical equipment, washing machines, and a few others. (Chemical manufacturing and oil & gas industries are the two largest consumers of heat exchangers in India, with each accounting for nearly one-fifth of total industry turnover in 2023. Other key end-use consumers are power & energy, HVAC, and metallurgy. Together, these five industries 
contributed to 80% of the heat exchanger industry revenue in 2023.)

g. They have increased their share of business from exports 10% to 15% increasing their customer range in Europe but still maintaining their current domestic order book.


4. Possible risks:

a. 75% of revenue is derived from top 10 customers which can pose a risk if some of them decide to change their component vendors

b. 80% of their raw materials are imported and any increase in tarrifs may affect financial performance 


5. Conclusion: Due to reasons mentioned above and the growth of the HVAC components industry, KRN is a strong long term investment and this might explain its meteoric stock price rise.

Disclaimer: I do have a vested interest in posting this, I have invested quite a bit of my portfolio in KRN, I did this when my company had a discussion with their MD and CHRO

That said, let me know your thoughts on KRN or if you have any questions. Will try to answer them.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"IPO reservations in India I recently got to know that India is one of the few countries (whose securities exchange) that mandates a certain portion of the IPOs must go to retail. I assumed that this was the norm across the world. In fact, at least 35% of each IPO must go to the public, which is significantly higher than any other country (that I could find). 

While there is certain benefit to the companies with this structure by diluting the ownership, it is implemented by SEBI to benefit the public. If there was no cap on how much institutional investors could buy up, the public would never be able to get any shares from the IPO. SEBI reserves 35% of the offering for the retailers like you and me so that we can benefit from the company’s growth. This reservation levels the playing field a little so that the profits trickle down to the common public more directly.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"IPO debacle and lessons learnt from it The recent Wework India IPO was a disaster in the making from the very beginning. As was expected, the listing gain was negative 2% today. Probably one of the worst IPOs Indian Stock Market has seen in this year. The company priced its shares too high, there were governance issues and promoters were embroiled in legal battles. All in all the long term viability of this company is seriously questionable. With losses in balance sheet, any analyst will instantly come to know that this IPO is not to make money but to offload risk.

I have come across several observations regarding such poor IPOs - 

  
1) IPOs have Book running lead managers (BRLMs) who function as not only agents of the company on stock exchanges but also perform the function of underwriting any risks related to the IPO.

  
2) BRLMs for wework india IPO were - JM Financials, ICICI Securities, Jefferies, Kotak Mahindra Capital and 360 one WAM. These BRLMs have been highly aggressive in listing companies on mainboard. 

  
3) Anchor Investors for the IPO were [these](https://www.chittorgarh.net/reports/anchor-investor/wework-india-intimation_anchor-allocation_wework.pdf).   
  
(To name a few - ICICI PRUDENTIAL TECHNOLOGY FUND, HDFC MUTUAL FUND - HDFC BUSINESS CYCLE FUND, HDFC MUTUAL FUND - HDFC INNOVATION FUND ,HDFC VALUE FUND, HDFC TRUSTEE COMPANY LTD, HDFC BALANCED ADVANTAGE FUND.)  
  
Anchor investors were subsidiaries of these BRLMs or their associate. It's clear that underwriters themselves asked their sister concerns to invest in this IPO. 

  
4) This is not the first time this has happened. [Ceigall India IPO](https://www.chittorgarh.net/reports/anchor-investor/ceigall_anchor_allocation_report.pdf) experienced something similar. My investment has almost halved from Rs 400 to cmp Rs 250 because I bought that company for long term, seeing the confidence of these big names as anchor investors in that IPO too. And guess who the underwriters in that offer were - ICICI Securities, JM Financial and same registrar MUFG Intime.  

What I learnt from it? 

1. There is clear conflict of interest when underwriter is himself the buyer.

What they have done is actually rigged the game well in advance -

* set the price band,
* Underwrite the issue (and must fill shortfall if undersubscribed),
* Invested in it themselves -  with **client (mutual fund) money**, not their own.

That’s not a vote of confidence, it’s **self-dealing** under the guise of “institutional support.”

2) BRLMs saved the IPO from getting cancelled as retail interest in these companies has been extremely inadequate. Meaning there must have been intense back channeling and kickbacks to fund managers to invest in these kind of IPOs.

3) AMCs have a fiduciary responsibility above all else. They can make any bids and take any risk as long as it is in concurrence with SEBI guidelines but when it is such a clear case of a poor company, the AMCs have literally, resorted to gambling, if not bribery. If their due diligence was so poor that they invested in such companies with poor financials, it raises serious doubts about the integrity and trust on the fund houses. 

4) Mutual Funds Sahi Hai? They handle such large amounts of assets that someone is bound to get greedy. With disclosures only mandated to monthly frequency, whatever they do with the money in the meantime is a black box, nobody knows.

5) As a corollary to my previous point, the huge amounts of assets under management with Mutual Funds, it makes it harder for their mistakes to come to the fore. But remember it's the compounding of small mistakes that brings down the house of cards, similar to what happened in 2008 crash.

6) IPOs are all about risk management and never about money for AMCs. Mutual Funds have a responsibility of safeguarding their client's money above all else. By taking on such risks they are just skirting on the edge of laws. Nobody can legally challenge their acquisition of IPO because it is well within the law but all these points about conflict of interest, rigging the game, fiduciary responsibility, transparency and ethics, assume a higher meaning when you become the backbone of our country's financial stability. 

Someone needed to drop this truth bomb and I hope investors of these AMCs, question these fund houses on their decision to bid in these poor IPOs. For such smart people that we Indians are, it comes as a shock to me how ignorant people can be when it comes to eliciting answers from faceless organisations. Nobody questions AMCs on their practices and their bad decisions.",1760111919.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1o34vly/ipo_debacle_and_lessons_learnt_from_it/

Even on a decent IPO oversubscriptions in retail segments were going crazy 8-12X whereas HNI category was normal. Allotment chances got harder and harder to counter that I planned to add more no. Of demat A/c. But that also didn't worked coz
 subscription went 15-18x. Me and our traders friends were eagerly waiting for that 1 bad IPO.   So these new entrants could get a lesson.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Before you jump into Tata Capital IPO. Please read this. The Tata Capital IPO is set to launch on October 6, 2025, and will close on October 8, 2025. The listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) is scheduled for October 13, 2025. This ₹15,511.87 crore issue includes a fresh issue of ₹6,846 crore and an offer for sale of ₹8,665.87 crore. The price band has been set between ₹310 and ₹326 per share, with a minimum lot size of 46 shares, translating to an investment of approximately ₹14,996 for retail investors. 


ANALYSIS
The Tata brand is strong, but here’s a closer look at the numbers:

•Profits: FY23 showed a high profit (~₹7,000cr), largely from a one-time gain. Core earnings come from interest on loans and fees, which are sensitive to RBI rate changes.

•Debt profile: Borrowings are significant. The housing finance subsidiary (TCHFL) has around 7% non-performing loans, compared with 1.9% overall.

•Cash flow: Free cash flow from core operations is modest. Provisions for bad loans fluctuate year-on-year, reflecting the nature of lending business.

•Key ratios: Capital adequacy is 16.9% (vs peers like Bajaj Finance at 21.9%). Provision coverage ratio has decreased from 74% → 58%. Return on equity was boosted by the one-time gain.

•Valuation: This is the company’s first IPO, so no prior stock performance. Employee stock options are high, which could dilute future shareholder value. Some assets use Level 3 valuation models, which are less transparent.

•Legal & tax matters: Tata Capital and its 
subsidiaries are involved in ~12,000 ongoing cases, including tax disputes worth ~₹5,600cr, consumer complaints, and borrower-related matters.

•Governance: The board largely consists of Tata insiders. There are risk committees, though subsidiaries continue to carry higher exposures.

Final take- Tata Capital combines a trusted brand and scale with certain financial and operational risks. Understanding the debt structure, subsidiary performance, and ongoing legal matters can help potential investors make an informed decision.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Tell me your best earning stocks in last one year and what was thought process while buying it? My Stock Market Experience

When I buy stocks, I first look at key metrics like market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and recent news, especially about new orders or developments related to the stock. After this analysis, I rely on my instincts to make a final decision. While I often make profits, there are times when I incur losses. However, over the last six months, my losses have outweighed my gains.

One stock where I had an interesting experience was Waaree Energies.

My Journey with Waaree Energies

I initially invested in this stock during its IPO. After receiving some shares in the IPO allotment, I bought additional shares on the listing day. I sold all my holdings at ₹2,500 a few days later. However, the stock rallied further to ₹3,800, leaving me regretting my early exit.

Later, when Donald Trump was elected as the U.S. President, the stock saw a downturn due to his policies. Trump frequently expressed his intent to impose duties on imports from China and India, impacting the renewable energy sector. I began buying the stock at ₹3,000, averaging down to ₹2,600, which brought my overall purchase price to ₹2,800. Eventually, I sold my holdings at ₹3,340, making a substantial profit.

Why I Chose Waaree Energies

I was exploring renewable energy stocks because of the increasing adoption of solar panels in households. The Indian government provides a ₹78,000 subsidy under the PM Suryaghar Yojana for installing household solar systems, which has boosted demand.

Despite some concerns over the stock’s valuation, I believed in Waaree because it has the largest solar module manufacturing capacity in India. My bet paid off.

An Important Learning

While I profited, I discovered that Waaree primarily generates revenue through exports rather than domestic household solar installations. This is because the government subsidy of ₹78,000 applies only to solar systems that comply with Domestic Content Requirements (DCR). When I explored installing a solar system for my household, I was surprised that the installer did not have Waaree panels. Despite being a market leader, Waaree did not have DCR-compliant panels in the widely preferred N-type TOPCon bifacial technology.

Currently, Waaree has introduced DCR-compliant panels but still lags in some advanced technologies. I believe the company will eventually produce the best panels in the industry. If the government relaxes DCR compliance rules, Waaree’s stock price could skyrocket.

My Current Outlook

The recent sell-off in Waaree’s stock has created another potential buying opportunity. I’m considering reinvesting in the company as I foresee strong growth in the renewable energy sector.

* If a company lists with a market cap above ₹5 trillion, it now needs to float only 2.5% shares instead of 5%.
* They’ve got up to 5–10 years to hit the 25% public shareholding rule (so promoters keep control longer).
* And foreign investors finally get a single-window clearance instead of endless paperwork.

On paper, this looks great — easier for companies to go public, less dilution, and more global money flowing in. But the flip side is that accountability gets stretched. Promoters can hold on to power for much longer, and we might see IPOs where the public has less real say for years.

Feels like a trade-off: we’ll probably get more blockbuster IPOs, but will investors actually benefit if governance takes a back seat?

Curious what others here think — is this smart policy to attract capital, or just a free pass for promoters to keep control?",1757760846.0,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nfuj1y/sebi_just_made_some_pretty_big_changes_to_ipo/
Reddit,urban company ipo,"fucking system is corrupt. Why Are Big Players Dominate SME IPOs? The SHNI Allotment Rule Needs to Change! 😡 please read it fully.

*Disclaimer: To save time, I made this post with the help of ChatGPT. These may not be my exact words, but the information provided is 100% accurate. If I’m missing something here, please help me understand this rule. I’ve chosen a more aggressive tone to reach more people and bring awareness to this garbage rule.*

Alright, it’s time someone called this out. The way SME IPO allotments work in the SHNI category is rigged in favor of fat-wallet investors, and it's beyond frustrating. If you don’t have ₹7 crore for {LAKSHYA POWERTECH } and 1.5 crore for {SHIVTEXCHEM} to throw around, just forget about getting an allotment when things are oversubscribed. And why? Because these **SHNI rules are outdated and shamelessly cater to those big players**, letting them hoard shares while average investors get nothing.

Here’s what’s happening: In the SHNI category, they use a **proportionate allotment** system, which sounds fair but actually just rewards those with massive applications. So, if you’re a regular investor applying for fewer shares, good luck. You’re competing against the sharks who’ll eat up the whole IPO because they can throw more money at it. This system needs a serious overhaul, and regulators like **SEBI should quit pandering to these big-money bullies** and start thinking about fairness.

**Why This Is Messed Up:**

1. **Fair Chance for Everyone? Total Lie.** When oversubscription happens, SHNI applicants should get random allotments like retail investors, plain and simple. But no, they let the big players walk away with guaranteed shares. Retail investors get randomized allotments when there’s high demand—why are SHNI investors any different?
2. **Leveling the Playing Field? Not Even Close.** Right now, SHNI rules just tell the average investor to “get lost” if they can’t pony up a fortune. You’d think IPOs would be about broad participation, but clearly, it’s just about sucking up to those who already have deep pockets.
3. **SEBI, Wake Up Already!** SEBI should be protecting us, the real investors, not catering to people who just keep inflating their piles of cash. It’s time SEBI got serious about fixing these allotment rules. SME IPOs should distribute shares fairly and not hand them over on a silver platter to the highest bidder.

**Final Thoughts:** This rule for SHNI allotments in oversubscribed IPOs is plain wrong, and SEBI needs to **grow a backbone and fix this mess**. Randomized allotment is long overdue, especially when demand skyrockets.

And here’s the kicker: even if these big players manage to secure, say, 20 SME allotments in a year, that’s nothing compared to the SME IPOs out there. Assuming the average size is ₹2.5 lakh and GMP is around 100%, they’re sitting on a cool ₹50 lakh profit *for the year*. They’re **raking it in** while the rest of us get scraps.

I have only analysed this two SME IPOs and found this and I am pretty much sure that this will follow in all SME IPOs and my mind is not believing just look at the allotment ration in the SHNI category and I feel like we guys just have to do something to make it more fairer I feel like its cheating to small people like me who just pray all days to god to get allotment but rules are really fucked up or else I am mad please help me to understand this and last thing if we check this for the mainstream IPOs this is not the case its totally based on the lottery system.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"$TDIC squeeze potential after $BYND # 🚀 **$TDIC Investment Thesis: Low Float, 70%+ Insider Owned, Short Squeeze Setup?** 🚀

**Dreamland Limited ($TDIC)** - Hong Kong event management company that IPO'd July 23, 2025. Traded **above $7** recently but got **hammered by shorts** to **~$0.61**. Low float + locked insider shares = **potential squeeze play**. Here's why I'm bullish:

---

## 📊 **Key Stats**
| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Insider Ownership** | **70.79-71.73%** (CEO Wai Yue Seto owns ~71.7%) |
| **Public Float** | **~8.76M shares** (out of 31M total) |
| **Short Interest** | **0.24-0.27%** (21.3K shares) |
| **Lock-up Expires** | **~Jan 19, 2026** (180 days from IPO) |
| **Recent High/Low** | **$6.75 → $0.61** |

---

## 💎 **Why Buy $TDIC Now?**

### 1️⃣ **INSIDER SKIN IN THE GAME**
- **70%+ owned by insiders** - they ain't selling anytime soon
- **Lock-up until Jan 2026** = no immediate dump risk from big holders
- Management aligned with shareholders

### 2️⃣ **LOW FLOAT = HIGH VOLATILITY**
- **8.76M float** = tiny supply for explosive moves
- Even modest buying volume can spike this hard
- **Short squeeze potential** if shorts pile in (currently low but could change)

### 3️⃣ **OVERSOLD AFTER SHORT ATTACK**
- Dropped from **$7+ to $0.61** on post-IPO selling + short pressure
- **Events industry recovering** - Hong Kong tourism booming
- Trading at **depressed levels** vs IPO valuation

### 4️⃣ **SQUEEZE CATALYSTS**
- **Low short interest** + **low float** = perfect setup
- **Upcoming earnings** could flip sentiment
- Social media buzz could ignite retail interest

---

## 🔥 **THE PLAY**
- **Entry**: ~$0.61 (current levels)
- **Target**: $3-5 short-term, $7+ if squeeze hits
- **Stop**: $0.40 (tight risk management)

**Float too small, insiders too locked, shorts too cocky.** This smells like a **classic squeeze setup**.

---

## ⚠️ **RISKS**
- **High volatility** - can drop further
- **Illiquid** - wide spreads, hard to exit
- **Events sector sensitive** to economy/regs
- **Geopolitical** Hong Kong risks

Reddit,galaxy medicare ipo,"4 years of applying to IPOs, taking out the principal, and keeping the profits for life. Current value of those profits: ~450k This is a follow-up to my [2024 post on another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1etkbad/3_years_of_applying_to_ipos_taking_out_the/).

I have been subscribing to IPOs (retail only) since 2021 and since the start I fixed the strategy: exit on listing regardless of the outcome. Take out the principal and keep the profit for lifetime. 

I have to admit I have deviated from that rule since last year and I have kept stocks like Tata Capital, Tata Tech, Bajaj HFL, etc. This is because I feel they'll do better in the long run. The Hyundai holding was an error and it proved good and so did the lone Kalpataru share.

I have 3 retail accounts (across me and my immediate family), so the first 3 images are from my family holdings. These demat accounts are only for IPOs, save the SETNIF50 holding you see in an image.

I do top-level research to form an opinion on all IPOs but over these 4 years, I have seen that markets are irrational. So, some bets go wrong, like for the ones listed below. Even then, impossible allotments like that of Jinkushal Industries recently results in negative listing. Which is why I have continued to stick to my strategy with the hope that in the long run, most of these keep growing. You can read more about my strategy on that other post.

While you don't see the discount listing issues here, I have listed them here: CarTrade, Nuvoco Vistas, Aptus, Sansera Engineering, ABSL AMC, PB Fintech, SJS Enterprises, PayTM, AGS Transact, Rainbow Children's Medicare, LIC, Keystone Realtors, Uniparts India, Digvi, Avalon Tech, Maoj Vaibhav, Updater Services, IRM Energy, Muthoot Microfin, Jana SFB, R K Swamy, Gopal Namkeen, Aadhar Housing Finance, Brigade Hotel Ventures, Leela, Ather Energy, Ajax Engineering, Carraro, and Hyundai. The total loss would be shy of about 80k.

Some stats:

* Out of the 631 applications across 3 retail accounts, I have been allotted 125 times. That's about 22% success rate
* If I didn't sell the allotted lots, I would be setting on a profit of 650k
* My best performing IPO is: IREDA (380%)
* My worst performing IPO is: TARSONS (-55%)",1760537639.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7c5e2

Reddit,euro pratik ipo,"Restaurant Brands Asia(formerly Burger King India) : how a PE promoter and management destroys shareholder wealth. Remember Burger King India business going public during covid with an IPO price of Rs 60 per share and having it's share debut at 125% premium raising Rs 810 crore. 

Few months on and Burger King India decides to go for a QIP, raising Rs 1400 crore to acquire Burger King Indonesia. 

The management rationale for the same was India and Indonesia demographics and taste were similar and it would be accretive for the business. 

Upon acquiring business, it shuttered few stores and redesigned it's menu. 

Sad reality is Burger King Indonesia business still has an Average Daily Sales(ADS) at levels before takeover and hasn't even recovered post covid. Heavy marketing was done for bk Indonesia. 

It wasn't enough for management that they acquired franchise rights for popeyes Business in Indonesia and opened 10 stores last financial year. 

A recently concluded con call with the management states how they're putting bk Indonesia on back burner and is focusing more on popeyes.

Amidst all this, Everstone PE, the promoter holding 40% shareholding is trying to sell off their stake happily pocketing massive returns unable to turn the business around. 

It was rumoured Jubilant foodworks was in the fray to acquire the stake but has denied it. 

Now, had management focused on Indian ops, it could've generated healthy margins in Indian business and would've had FCF positive earlier. 

Qsr is a difficult business to run and so far only jubilant foodworks previous ceo Pratik pota Has made dominoes a giant and is struggling post his exit. 

The bk india  management is quite unexperienced and clueless in turning around the business and will languish behind mcdonald's india(Westlife development).",1684498770.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/13ltv4s/restaurant_brands_asiaformerly_burger_king_india/
Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"JSW Cement IPO: A Bet Against the Giants JSW Cement, a part of the JSW Group, opens its IPO on August 7. The ₹3,600 crore issue includes ₹1,600 crore fresh capital, mainly to fund a new Rajasthan plant and repay ₹520 crore of debt. This move could strengthen its presence in North India and improve its cost structure.

But here’s the challenge India’s cement market is dominated by giants like Ultratech and Adani, who enjoy massive scale advantages. JSW Cement is smaller, with 20 MTPA capacity and low utilization (62.9%), meaning growth depends on efficient ramp up of new projects and better distribution.

Will this IPO be a game changer or just a survival move? The big question is whether JSW Cement can break through in a thin margin, hyper competitive industry and deliver post listing growth.",1754478797.0,17,https://i.redd.it/wmsxirwytdhf1.jpeg

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"Not a fan of ipos but I'm generally not a big fan of IPOs because I don't see them as great long-term investments. However, lately, I've been hearing a lot about the growing popularity and brand recognition of JSW paints and cement from my friends in the construction industry. This has me thinking about whether the JSW Cement IPO might be an exception to my rule.
From what I've read, JSW Cement is positioning itself as a ""green"" cement company, which is an interesting angle given the growing focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing. They're reportedly India's largest producer of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), and their CO2 emissions are significantly lower than their competitors. This, combined with the overall infrastructure boom in India, seems to create a compelling growth story.
However, a closer look at their financials reveals some red flags. The company's revenue has been relatively flat over the last couple of years, and it actually posted a loss in the most recent fiscal year (FY25) after being profitable in the previous years. Their debt-to-equity ratio is also quite high, and their margins are lower than some of the industry leaders. The IPO proceeds are intended to fund new expansion projects and repay debt, which could be a positive, but it also highlights the company's high capital expenditure and leverage.
The IPO was subscribed around 8 times, with strong interest from institutional investors, but the retail portion saw a more moderate response. The GMP (Grey Market Premium) has been fluctuating, suggesting a somewhat cautious but stable listing.
So, for those of you who are more familiar with the cement industry or have experience with IPOs, what's your take on JSW Cement as a long-term investment?",1755111523.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1mpd9qu/not_a_fan_of_ipos_but/

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"83% returns in 9 months! Hello everyone! I’m a 21 year old Final year Engineering student who during the Covid Market Crash forced his father to invest in the stock market for long term investments. I was always fascinated with the stock market but never pursued it due to my studies 

Being a novice I made him invest around 9L in around 35+ companies and today we are on a profit of 7.5L. (Nothing to boast as the even investing simply in the index would have given the same returns but still makes me happy) 
I am still a learner and while shortlisting companies would search on basic fundamentals like Debt, P/E, ROCE, long term price chart and the business itself.

In past 7-8 months I’ve learned a lot more about stock markets and now aim to reduce the portfolio of 30 companies to 15-20 quality companies only and mainly reduce some PSU’s (added a lot thinking monopoly but later got to know how badly most PSU’s perform). 

My dad recently asked me if I want to sell some of the stocks but I told him that this is a portfolio for 5 years and we won’t touch anything until then (except some cyclical stocks) 

Below is my portfolio (no particular order)

1. Havells 
2. Voltas
3. Asian Paints
4. Bajaj Finance 
5. Bajaj Finserv
6. HDFC Bank
7. ICICI Bank
8. IndusInd Bank
9. Axis Bank
10. SBI
11. SBI Cards
12. Indian Oil
13. Coal India
14. Infibeam Avenues 
15. Affle India
16. JSW Steel
17. Vedanta
18. Indian Hotels Company
19. NBCC
20. Jamna Auto
21. Hinduja Global Solutions 
22. KNR Constructions 
23. Sonata Software 
24. VIP Industries 
25. ITC
26. ONGC
27. L&T Technology Services
28. Bosch
29. Cummins India
30. Siemens 
31. HDFC
32. ACC Cement
33. BEL
34. HDFC AMC
35. M&M Finance

(All these stocks were bought between April-Jun)

I know some of the stocks are not that strong fundamentally for long term and since at the time of purchase my knowledge was very limited they are in the portfolio. Would be booking profits on some of these stocks and trim the portfolio soon. 



Also after August (getting Campus placement), I opened my own Demat Account and started investing small amounts of money I had had as savings and build the below portfolio. I have invested around 90K between September till Date and currently have unrealised profit of 30K. I have invested only small amounts of money in each company except Burger King which was IPO Allotment. 

1. Burger King (lucky to get IPO allotment)
2. ITC
3. Abbot India
4. Mahanagar Gas 
5. Airtel
6. Aurobindo Pharma
7. Birla Corporation 
8. Gujarat State Petro Limited
9. Angel Broking 
10. Accelya Solutions Limited 
11. GMM Pfaudler
12. City Union Bank
13. Granules India 
14. ICICI Lombard Insurance
15. Coforge

 **Business**  


JSW infra is the port operations business of JSW group  
**2nd largest commercial port operator**  
9 Port Concessions ( 7 in India)  


provide cargo handling, logistics services,storage solutions, and other value-added services to our customers  


Ports and port terminals of JSW Infra have long concession periods- **Current weighted average remaining concession period is 25 years.**   
Location of ports are diversified, strategically located closer to JSW Group customers (JSW Steel, JSW Energy), covering vast industrial belt hinterlands.  
.   


**Future plans**  
JSW Infra aims to achieve capacities of 300 MTPA by 2030 ( 158MTPA FY23)  
They will also focus on diversification of cargo mix, increase third party customers business share from 33%  
Main competitors are Adani ports, Gujarav Pipavav, JM Baxi.   


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Industry overview**  


**Port traffic in FY 23 was 783 million tonnes in major ports, 650 million tonnes in non-major ports.** Overseas cargo formed 79% of movement, rest coastal cargo.  
India has 212 non-major ports and 12 major ports.  Ports handle 90% by volume and 70% by value of India’s external trade.  


**Major commodity wise port traffic (FY 23)**  


Coal traffic                   367 MMT  
Crude oil & products   443 MMT  
Iron Ore                         100 MMT  
**Major vs minor ports**  


Non-major ports have lesser congestion levels vs major ports, as major ports have access channel is sharing. The cargo ramp-up possibility at non-major ports is also higher.**Poor operational performance of major ports and aggressive expansion undertaken by non-major ports has resulted in traffic being diverted to non-major ports.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Operating metrics**  


  


Capacity utilization at 57% ( similar to India average 56%).   
Cargo volume handled- India is 93 MMT in FY 23.  
   
**Revenue mix**  


JSW Group 52%  
Third party 33%  
Vessel related charges 15%   
**64% repeat customers.** JSW Group companies are mainly JSW Steel and JSW energy.  


**Revenue mix- Cargo handled (Total revenues 3190cr)**  


Thermal coal  27%  
Iron ore          30%  
Other than thermal coal 25%

52% of business comes from **captive customer base** of JSW Energy & JSW Steel. 64% of revenues is from repeat customers. **This is a an important moat, though Adani & GPPL also has this.**  


**Long term leases of operating ports is another moat**. JSW Infra has average 25 years of lease agreement time remaining for ports it operates  
**40% of revenues come from JSW Steel- very high customer concentration,** which may affect the business of JSW Infra in case JSW Steel business suffers.  


Port operations are subject to environmental clearances and scrutiny of National Green Tribunal. Operations may get hampered if it comes under violations of ESG clearances

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"Tomorrow Market Prediction: Simple Insights and a Real Plan for September 23, 2025 Hey there! Welcome back to Replete Equities. As always, I want you and me to look at the market’s ups and downs together and find out what matters for YOU—because that’s what counts. Let’s keep it simple, practical, and focus on a trading plan you can actually use tomorrow.

How Was the Market Today? Quick Recap
Let’s talk about what really happened. Today, the Nifty 50 dropped by about 125 points and ended at 25,202. The Sensex also slipped by 466 points, closing at 82,160.

Why? Honestly, it felt like a day when people wanted to lock in some profits—especially after the market recently climbed higher. The big story was all about the IT sector (think TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Wipro)—they fell because the US increased H-1B visa fees, making investors nervous about their future costs. Even big names like Reliance and Tata Motors weren’t safe from selling.

But (and here’s the bright spot!) some shares like Adani Enterprises, Bajaj Finance, and UltraTech Cement did quite well. Still, smaller and mid-sized stocks weren’t spared—profit booking was everywhere. Plus, the India VIX (I call this the market’s “nervous meter”) jumped up by nearly 6%, so expect some more bumpy rides ahead.

Here’s What to Watch: Clear Support & Resistance Levels
I know numbers can get confusing. Let’s keep it straightforward—here’s what I’ll watch with you tomorrow, using the latest data:

For Nifty 50
Support:
I see 25,200 as the first “safety net.” If things get more volatile, then 25,100 is the backup, and really watch out for 25,000 if the mood turns negative.

Resistance:
On the way up, 25,350 to 25,400 is the main hurdle right now as a lot of call options are expiring here—so it’ll take some work for Nifty to cross this range. If you do see a breakout, watch for 25,450 as the next area that could slow things down, thanks to heavy call writing.

My view? The Nifty could bounce from support, but unless we see a strong move above those resistance levels (and big volumes), I wouldn’t bet big on a big up day.

For Bank Nifty
Closed at 55,459 today.

Support: 55,000 is the most important “floor” for now. If it slips, then 54,800 catches my attention. These levels have a good cushion from put option buyers showing up strong.

Resistance: Resistance is around 55,300 to 55,400 as call writers are active, and if we get a strong move above, then look for action all the way to 56,000.

If you see Bank Nifty break cleanly above resistance, that’s a good sign. But if it falls below those support levels, it might be best to stand aside for a bit.

What Are Options Telling Us? (Kept Simple!)
Let’s stay real—option chain activity tells us what the bigger traders expect for tomorrow’s range:

In Nifty, the main “fight” is between 25,100 (lots of support—many puts) and 25,350-25,400 (lots of resistance—many calls). The market is likely to stay between these zones for now, as neither side has a clear win.

Heavy call option open interest at 25,400 makes this a stubborn resistance.

At the same time, open interest near 25,200 and support at 25,100 means many buyers are ready below.

The PCR (put-call ratio) is pretty neutral right now, showing neither the bulls nor the bears have a major upper hand.

For Bank Nifty, the action is similar:

Support at 55,000–54,800, resistance at 55,300–55,400, and next-level resistance near 56,000.

No strong trend yet—so range trading is still the safest approach.

Summary: Don’t expect the market to go wild unless you see a real breakout past these numbers. It’s a “wait, react, and protect your profits” kind of day.

Hot Topics and Headlines YOU Should Know
Here’s what really moved the market and might matter tomorrow:

US visa fee hike put pressure on IT shares. If more news drops, expect more drama there.

Some foreign investors picked up Indian stocks, especially hoping for good company profits soon.

India’s tax changes (GST) and a stable monsoon could quietly support the market in the weeks to come.

The US cut rates again, which sometimes makes global investors bolder in buying stocks.

Tomorrow, there’s no major IPO launching, but company splits (like Adani Power) could shake up some prices.

How I’d Plan MY Trades for Tomorrow (And How You Can Too!)
Here’s my real, personal plan for Tomorrow Market Prediction:

Nifty Range: I plan to buy if Nifty goes near 25,200 or even 25,100, with a stop below 25,000. I’ll only get aggressive if Nifty powers above 25,400 and stays there.

Bank Nifty: I’ll be careful if it drops below 55,000. If it pushes up through 55,400 and holds, then I might look for buys, potentially all the way to 56,000.

Stock Sectors: I’ll still stay away from IT for now—too much uncertainty with those visa headlines. Instead, I’ll keep my focus on sectors like consumption, industry, and companies that people still need even when things get shaky.

Market Sentiment: With VIX up, I’d use safer strategies. I won’t take big risks—just trade the range, protect profits, and wait for a clearer breakout.

The biggest lesson? Don’t force any trade—patience is profitable!

Final Thoughts—My Honest Take
Markets will always have their scary days and sideways moves. If you and I stick with our plan, cut losses quickly, and size up only when things are super clear, we’ll do better over time.

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"i know it's over diversified and the portfolio is shit, but i need suggestions [This portfolio has a story better than Pushpa 2 lol. So half of the stocks were suggested by a random dude on instagram and idk how but 99&#37; of the time, his suggestions were spot on. Apparently he was part of a trading company. I made crazy gains thru him, but I deleted my instagram account out of some personal reasons. After that I decided to start my own research and few of the stocks are result of my research. My first bet was Zomato which went really really well. So instead of consolidating the existing companies, I started buying new shares. I agree this was a dumb decision. Then I got busy in my exams and didn't have much time to research. So I bought shares just on the company's name. Some of these shares are Mahindra Logistics, Paras, Exide Industries, TVS Supply Chain and others. As you can see, most of them did decently well. Then I applied for Hyundai IPO with literally zero research. I thought since it's a big IPO of a big company, it'll eventually go up. I know, again a dumb decision, but here we are. Now the problem is, I can't figure out which ones to hold and which one to sell. As of now, I don't have time to research all of them. I will start studying finance & stock market soon, as it is included in my syllabus, but it'll start after 4-5 months. Until then I wanted a starting point regarding my portfolio. Those who have experience, what are the immediate red flags you've noticed? What suggestions do you have for me?\(other than to learn stock market lol\) Also, this is just 66&#37; of my total portfolio. The rest 34&#37; is in mutual funds with XIRR of 20.40&#37;.

CDSL - India is witnessing a massive rise in retail investors and Demat account openings. CDSL has 75% market share so it benefits from Longterm demat account openings growth. Revenue depends on market conditions.

VBL - They are expanding rapidly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, as far I have read. Their revenue and profit has also been rising at great number on YoY basis.

JSW ENERGY - Most of their Renewable energy plants are to be made operational by the end of 2025 or first quarter of 2026, So I expect they will start to generate Revenue from 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2026.

REC Limited - They basically finance Power Sector, Almost 100% of their income comes from interests. I also read that they are expanding their business in Infrastructure Financing too, and at current PE of 6 it’s so worthy to add this in your portfolio.

BLUESTARCO - This company makes AC, Refrigerator, Coolers and few others. The rising global temperatures make this stock interesting and also the rising Data centers and Offices also gives this stock a great potential. Comparing with UAE which is 100% Airconditioned, our country is so far behind. Has potential due to its revenue and sales growth too.

KPITTECH - They provide Software solutions for Automobile companies mainly in Europe. I think they might benefit from Rising demand in EV. 

RELIANCE - No need to mention, It’s clearly visible they are slowly shifting towards Retail and Telecom. They are also planning an IPO for Jio this year. I trust Ambani and his big brains. 


CAMS - Just like CDSL but not stocks, they  manage Mutual funds transactions and also has 70% Market share. Just like cdsl this also moves based on Indias growth and mutual funds participation. 


** Please note this is not Fixed Deposit, All these are my Analysis and the 20-25% CAGR is what I’m expecting will happen by 2030.

This is not a stock recommendation, Take this as an education post and do your analysis on top of it. Thank you!",1744161082.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1jutt8k/best_indian_stocks_to_buy_for_longterm_at_current/

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"Will GRASIM disrupt PAINTS industry ? **Paints industry is up for a rejig.**

 Of d **60000 crore industry** , leader Asian Paints control 42% of total. 

32% is still unorganized sector. 

Though new players like JSW Paints n Indigo Paints are too small , **Grasim is set to disturb d industry  structure with 10000cr investment**,  capacity of 1330 million litres/ yr by F24 end. 

Asian paints capacity is 1700 Ml set to increase to 2600 Ml now. 

&#x200B;

**Such big capacity addition of Grasim will surely call for huge ad spends n price war to sell the product, which may affect d margins of Asian p n Berger also** since volume growth of industry is going to remain same at 10-13% . It is likely that there will be no market share loss of AP, Berger.  

**Usually smaller players lose market share in such wars,** so Indigo, Akzo,  Kansai will lose here. If price war continues longer, PE de-rating may happen also for AP, Berger as ROCEs may drop . ( from 70 levels ) . 

Investors in Asian paints, Berger may keep a watch on F25 results.  

&#x200B;

**Grasim already has a big dealer network** thru their already selling product Birla White wall putty ( top 3 player) . Plus they have Ultratech cement network in market. This will help them create a distribution channel much faster than any other new company.

 Nothing will change for Asian paints, they will remain d market leader. Only wealth compounding that happened for last 20 yrs may not happen for next 20 yrs, that is d bad news.

 But given its DNA to excel, Asian paints will find an alternative way to grow at this pace,  maybe in some other associated new business.

No other rival can challenge , only Grasim may, all depends on its appetite n aggression. But if a small player like Indigo can take 3% ms from Kansai n Akzo, Grasim will do lot more , maybe in 5 yrs , they will have 15%. Also another thing will happen, as per capita income increases in next 10 yrs, share of unorganized ind will reduce from 33% . That market share will go to Grasim maybe.

&#x200B;

**But Grasim has to burn a lot of money to get to that position. It's not easy.**

 So they are spending 10000cr to setup d business from their cash accrued in commodity business  . 

**Now they have to match ad spending of Asian paints which is 1200cr/yr**. So they have to spend 5000cr in 5 yrs only in ads to reach there.   


**Plus they will operate at lower margins** ( lower prices possibly or discounting) to capture market as they wont hv any brand power for 5 yrs. They will hv to give more margins to dealers than other players to lure them to sell their products. They will hv to create a high sales manpower incentives structure to reach there . 

15% market share achieving from scratch is not easy thing. ( they aspire to be no 2)  Possibly they wont earn much in paints business for next 5-7 yrs. 

&#x200B;

**What views other people have? Please share.**

So you might say that its simplistic because nifty is a weighted index, so I download the weights, of each company, instead of summing up price and EPS blindly, I will only add percentage of EPS and price.

&#x200B;

Example right now, HDFC is weighted 13.3% and Reliance industry is weighted around 9% so my P/E nifty formula looks like this:

&#x200B;

>P/E = ((0.13) \* price of HDFC + (0.09 \* price of Reliance) + ..... + ..) / ((0.13 \* EPS of HDFC + 0.09 \* EPS of reliance) + .... )

so the P/E that I am getting now is around 30. when I Check online the current PE is around 21. What am I doing wrong ?

&#x200B;

Below is my table

WiEi stands for weight of i th company multiplied of EPS of ith company

WiPi stands for Weight of i th company multiplied by price of company.

&#x200B;

so Nifty P/E = Sigma (Wi \* Pi) / Sigma(Wi \* Ei) Which I am getting as 29. This feels little high as other websites quite unanimously claim nifty 50 PE is around 21-23.

&#x200B;

**Industry overview**

Infra development is one of the key drivers of a developing economy. In budget 2023, govt. **increased allocation to infra budget by 33% YOY to Rs 10 lakh crore** ( 3x the budget of 2019). Govt. has launched National Infra Pipeline ( NIP) , PLI scheme to boost infra developments. **Financial assistance of Rs1,30,000cr interest free loans for 50 years has been allocated to states for infra push.**  


**Water supply**   
India  is home to 18% of world's population and 4% of fresh water reserves. In  2022, 17% of households are reported to have access to tap water  connections. Govt. has launched **Jal Jeevan Mission** to bridge this gap, with **total project outlay of Rs 3,60,000cr.  FY 24 budgetary allocation is Rs 70000cr.**  


**Waste water treatment** is another scope of work. **72% of waste water is left untreated currently.** Govt is pushing for waste water treatment, agricultural water re-use, industrial water re-use, River Ganga treatment.  


**Rail infra**  
The Government has proposed a **70% YOY increase in budgetary allocation of Rs 2,40,000 to Railways in Budget FY 24.** **Govt is aiming for 45% share of rail in freight transport by 2030 ( current 27%)**,  for that they are initiating different projects under PPP model. Govt.  is looking for 100% electrification of railways and introducing  automation across operations.  


**Roan Infra**  
In **budget FY24, Govt allocated  Rs 2,70,000 towards road construction** ( Rs1,99,000cr in FY23).  


 **Total order book stands at 3880cr**  (July '23) ( Annual Revenues 1170cr)  
77% of order book is from Rajasthan (61%) and UP, so there is geographical concentration of 2 states.  
81% revenues generated from top 5 clients, so there is very high client concentration.  


&#x200B;

**Financials**   


Annual revenues of Vishnu Prakash is 1170cr.  PAT  90cr.  
**67% of revenue came from Rajasthan projects.**  
Revenue from operations increased at CAGR of 55%, PAT increased at CAGR of 118% from FY 21 to FY 23.

**Profits have become 5X in last 2 years.**  
EBITDA margins expanded from 9.7% to13.5% in 2 years. ( peers PNC Infra, HG Infra at 19-21%, NCC , RVNL at 10%)  
PAT margins have expanded from 3.9% to 7.7%  
ROCE at healthy 33%, increased a lot  in 2 years.  


 

**Balance sheet**  


Trade receivables 197 cr ,low considering it is a B2B business mostly with govt parties.  
Cash/ bank balance is 70cr  
Total borrowings 250 cr   
Debt equity ratio  0.8 ( most peers operate at similar or higher debt)  
Cashflow from operations (CFO) negative.  
Contingent liabilities 277cr.  


**Points to consider**  


1. Vishnu Prakash has 36 years of experience in Water supply projects, which is their core area of focus. **(78% of order book)**  


2. Robust order book of 3800cr ( more than 3x of current revenues) is a big plus.  


3.In-house integration model and relations with govt departments through years of project execution is an advantage.  


4.**Geographical concentration in Rajasthan and UP is a risk ( 77% of order book)**. 67% of FY 23 revenues came from Rajasthan projects.  


5. Also there is significant client concentration risk with 81% revenues coming from top 5 clients.  


6. Cashflow  from operations being negative, and business being high working capital  intensive ( which may increase anytime if any big payment is further  delayed), they will need to raise further money for working capital if  revenue has to grown so steeply ( IPO proceeds of 150cr will be utilized  for  this)  


**Valuation**  


Vishnu  Prakash R Punglia is valued at P/E of 13 ( bigger peers PNC Infra, HG  Infra, NCC valued between 13-16, while RVNL at 18, ITD Cementation at  25)

Here are my bets with a 3 year horizon. These are buy, hold and forget stocks for me. Very brief DD for your reference. _I'm not an advisor, do your own research:_

1. **Zuari Global**: Part sugar play, holding company of Zuari Agro, Texmaco Rail, Texmaco infra, promoter of upcoming Paradeep Phosphates IPO, runs the Hettich Business, real estate projects in Dubai and Mysore. CMP 170.  



2. **Mukand Limited**: Speciality Steel Player, owned by the Bajaj group now (was a JV with the Shah family until August 2021). Play on specialty Steel, proper capital allocation by Bajaj group going forward, PLI scheme for their products coming up. CMP 136.  



3. **Hindustan Media Ventures Ltd**: owns the Hindustan hindi newspaper, stakes in Oyo and Mobikwik, bank fixed deposits larger than current market Cap. CMP 80.



4. **Royal Orchid Hotels**: very good financial fundamentals. Will surprise once hospitality starts performing. CMP 90.

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"Market Summary 22nd July 2022 Market Summary 22nd July 2022

The market remained range-bound after a positive start, but buying in the second half, particularly in banking names, helped the indices close near the day's high.

At the close, the Sensex had risen 390.28 points, or 0.70 percent, to 56,072.23, while the Nifty had risen 114.20 points, or 0.69 percent, to 16,719.50. The Sensex and Nifty both gained 4% for the week. Gains in index heavyweight Reliance Industries and financial services firms such as HDFC, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank aided the 50-stock index's rise.

During the week, the Nifty successfully broke through the short-term resistance of 16300, as well as the 100-day SMA. 16800 and 16950 would be immediate resistance levels for traders, while 16500-16350 could be key support levels.

**Bank Nifty:**

The Bank Nifty opened at 36,323 and continued its upward trend to reach the day's high of 36,823. It has to hold above 36,666 to witness an up move towards 37,000 and 37,250, while on the downside, support is seen at 36,500 and 36,250.

Option data movement:

The highest Call open interest was seen at the 17,000 strike, followed by the 16,500 strike, and the highest Put open interest was seen at the 16,000 strike, followed by the 15,500 strike. We saw Call writing at 16,700, followed by 17,000 strike, and Put writing at 16,600, followed by 16,500 strike.

According to the options data, the trading range for the Nifty could be 16,400-17,000.

**l** **Top Gainers**: UltraTech Cement, Grasim Industries, UPL, HDFC, and HDFC Bank.

**l** **Top Losers:** Tata Consumer Products, Infosys, NTPC, Power Grid Corporation, and JSW Steel.

l Rupee ends 10 paise higher at 79.85 per dollar.

**Our view for the next trading session :**

Oscillators on daily charts showed a positive sentiment, but turned negative on lower timeframes, indicating the index may be overbought. For the Nifty, 16,500 will be a crucial support level, while the resistance could be at 16,800 and then 17,000

Because the index is consistently trading above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), dips can remain a buying opportunity as long as it closes above 16,500.

The Nifty is overbought, with a 25-day-old channel resistance at around 16,752; if it falls below 16,610, it may attract selling pressure towards 16,500-16,480.

Only on a dip will the best buying opportunity emerge, and long-side traders should book profits by taking advantage of the current strength.",1658495501.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/w5aao3/market_summary_22nd_july_2022/

It was a small public issue in terms of size among the IPOs that were launched in December. The company mopped up Rs 126 crore through the offer that saw strong demand from investors.

The offer was subscribed 20.96 times during December 15-17 as the portion set aside for retail investors saw a whopping 81.24 times subscription and that of non-institutional investors saw 19.04 times subscription. A part set aside for qualified institutional buyers was subscribed 1.82 times.

The price band for the public issue was Rs 262-274 per equity share.

Most of analysts gave a ‘subscribe’ rating for the issue from the fast-growing adhesives and sealants company with established brand presence.

“Considering the trailing twelve months or TTM (September 2021) adjusted EPS of Rs 5.57 on the post-issue basis, the company is going to list at a P/E (price-to-earnings) of 49.23 with a market cap of Rs 503.5 crore, while its peer namely, Pidilite Industries, is trading at P/E of 89.75,” said Marwadi Financial Services.

The brokerage had assigned ‘subscribe’ rating to this IPO.

Hem Securities had also recommended ‘subscribe’ on the issue. “The company with its wide product portfolio addressing the needs of varied customers across the industry has experienced promoters with a strong management team having domain knowledge. Also, with extensive sales and distribution network, it has strategically located manufacturing facilities with improving operational efficiency,” it said.

The company offers a wide range of consumer adhesives and sealants such as PVC, cPVC and uPVC solvent cement, synthetic rubber adhesive, PVA adhesives, silicone sealant, acrylic sealant, gasket shellac, other sealants and PVC pipe lubricant which are sold across India.

In FY21, the company sold its products across 21 countries, including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Ghana, Greece, Iraq, Kuwait, Mauritius, the UK and the US.

HP Adhesives had posted a profit of Rs 10.06 crore in the financial year ended by March 2021 as against a loss of Rs 4.67 crore a year back, while revenues during the same period rose to Rs 118.16 crore from Rs 95.47 crore.

Profit in the six months ended September 2021 stood at Rs 3.1 crore, up from Rs 2.93 crore in the corresponding period last year. Revenue jumped to Rs 70.51 crore in first half of FY22, up from Rs 44.92 crore in first half of FY21.",1640583222.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/rpfvp2/hp_adhesives_makes_strong_debut_with_16_premium/

Reddit,all time plastics ipo,"Analysis of the healthcare sector in India! Fellow redditors, since all of you showcased so much love on my last post, I am here to contribute more to this sub and hopefully enhance the quality of posts here. Today, I am going to be doing an extensive analysis of the healthcare sector in India. I believe that this is a very underpenetrated zone with robust growth potential. 

Spoiler: For those who are looking for stock recommendations, I’m going to save you some time and tell you that there are none in this post. I am not going to step into the same zone as certain finfluencers and tell you guys what to buy since I am not an advisor, nor are most of them btw. I am going to be giving a broad overview of what I think the healthcare sector is going to look like in a few years, the growth triggers and the general valuations. 

For those who struggle with reading long posts, I would say this is the time for you to try and go to chat gpt to ask for a summary and for chatGPT to miss out on the majority of the statistics and points that I will try and put forth. This is exactly how you end up having weak convictions in businesses. 

The following are my personal views supported by market forecasts and statistics.

I am sure a lot of you must be seeing a significant consolidation in your portfolios for the past few months. It is also hard to point out exactly what triggers are impacting the market, I think it was overheated valuations, but some might say it was the US imposing tariffs, stronger dollar or reallocation to other undervalued markets. While some might complain about the market collapsing and that stocks will never reach the same levels again (not my comments but things I’ve read on this subreddit), I believe that this is a great time for accumulation. I know a lot of us might be struggling with the fact that you might be 100% invested in the markets, if that is the case then just hold on to fundamentally strong companies and you should be good. For those who have cash on hand, this is a golden opportunity to slowly accumulate. 

Now coming to the healthcare industry. What is interesting to watch in market downturns is the fact that because investor sentiment is low and the markets are fearful, people tend to offload stock from all sectors, even the ones that might be doing well and are growing at a good pace. The great thing about this sector is that it cannot be impacted much by foreign policies or tariffs unlike the IT sector. India remains a highly under-penetrated zone when it comes to hospitals and there is a huge demand for more infrastructure. 

https://preview.redd.it/p9apgjlfvpje1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e3a915fb377dc696f0a1921756a9fcd9285f5de

When you have a look at this image, you can clearly see the lack of infrastructure we have. This was also highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was a large shortfall of availability of beds in hospitals. Since our population is similar to China, I would assume that our basic requirements should be close to theirs. I would not say that we should expect the average to go all the way up to 50 but I would assume somewhere around the 35 scale should be the target. This is again my own analysis; I would hope that we can at least achieve the world average. This is trigger number one.

Furthermore, since we all know the AQI levels around the country, which btw I don’t think will become better anytime soon, this will lead to further health issues in the long term. These are long term opportunities. Take major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Haryana where air quality is at its worst, people residing there will definitely need to seek medical services in the long term, nobody can sustain such harmful toxins. This is exactly why hospitals in North India are growing at a much faster pace when compared to any other side in India. 

https://preview.redd.it/pouj1e2dvpje1.jpg?width=1180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14aad56bafaf19aeb1520fdcba8a35c58c5844ca

Even if we consider a mid-point growth of 10% Y-o-Y, then we can see just how big of a market this would be going in the future. The good thing about this is that we are currently at a stage where hospitals are rapidly expanding and you will see a lot of private chains making several acquisitions, this is all because they know the opportunities that lie ahead. Another major thing to consider is that government only has a fixed amount of Capex that they can deploy to fund or expand hospitals, which is why the burden is on the private sector to grow and fill the necessary gaps, this is really beneficial because we have a lot of private players who are already listed and some who are ready for an IPO. This is exactly why you will be seeing a shift in the market share that private hospitals have. Below is the forecasted change. 

[I believe that this is a very conservative forecast](https://preview.redd.it/q613rfawupje1.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e97a161c55ddcc21ccbae53bc3f6744e51b1efc)

Another important thing to keep an eye out for is the fact that the government has launched the ‘Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)’. For those of you who are not aware of this policy, this is an initiative that the government has taken to provide health coverage to all senior citizens of the age 70 years and above irrespective of income. This is aimed to benefit around 4.5 crore families. This is huge! This means that going forward people would prefer to seek private healthcare because they have a coverage of up to 5 lakhs. You can read more about this here:[AB PM-JAY | Prime minister of India](https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-health-coverage-to-all-senior-citizens-of-the-age-70-years-and-above-irrespective-of-income-under-ayushman-bharat-pradhan-mantri-jan-arogya-yojana-ab-pm-jay/). It has not even been a full year since the rollout began, which means that going forward we can see a lot more people visiting private hospitals. This is trigger number two. 

https://preview.redd.it/eetra9y3vpje1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcdf7bb4285de28e9bc37232b3e7f25f75126d34

There is clearly a very low concentration of private sector penetration, and this graph helps us visualize the market that is yet to be penetrated. 

Trigger number three is how cheap our medical facilities are when compared to the rest of the world. India holds a big price moat over the rest of the world when it comes to medical services. This is why we are witnessing a wave of medical tourism in India. This was something that was also mentioned in Budget 2025, the idea of “Heal in India”. This is an initiative that has the potential to bring a lot of money to India and obviously the government sees that and is trying to provide streamlined e-visa facilities along with visa-fee waivers for certain tourist groups. I would highly encourage you to read this: [Press Release: Press Information Bureau](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2099519). Below are the price comparisons between major countries to prices in India and you can clearly see the difference. 

https://preview.redd.it/0xzwggizupje1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2be4c9b78103c114f8a6815fa75fe27a23286ff

Medical tourism is growing at a very high pace at the moment. There was a time during the pandemic where it had slipped significantly, but we are starting to see a strong bounceback. I believe that if the sector plays its card correctly, then we can see a massive inflow of money. You can compare this to medical tourism in Korea as well; there is a significant incentive for people to fly to Korea for plastic surgeries due to the significant price difference. Their economy has massively benefitted from this! I believe that there are opportunities for our market to grow beyond that scale just because of our price competitiveness. 

[I believe that this forecast is pretty conservative, and that India has the potential to attract more than 30 lakh tourists by 2030e. ](https://preview.redd.it/qvhh5cr0vpje1.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceccd913db372a47f3819f4dd700f17c8e8e4512)

India is also starting to see more people buying health cover than before. This is very interesting because more people holding health insurance means that people would be visiting for every health issue they have instead of trying to seek cheap remedies and fixing the issue by themselves. Companies are also starting to offer health insurance as part of their employees' overall package, this means that more people are going to be holding more insurance policies going forward.

Something to keep an eye out for is that several healthcare companies have seen their shares significantly fall in the past months, even though most of the companies reported decent to good earnings. It is also important to point out that unlike a lot of sectors, healthcare is not cyclical, people don’t choose when they want to fall sick, therefore these are stocks which, regardless of market conditions, should be reporting numbers that are in-line with expectations. 

Some of the companies are available at great valuation at this point and there are also some that are trading at crazy prices. I would highly recommend that you do your due diligence of which business you want to invest in and try keeping an eye out for the points that I have highlighted. Good companies would be expanding and trying to capture the medical tourism market. Look for their geographical locations, the markets they are trying to cover and the level of specializations that they offer at their hospitals. I believe that this sector gets overlooked quite often by investors, however I feel that going forward, it has the opportunity to generate great wealth for investors. 

Of course, I cannot cover every single incentive or trigger for this industry in a single post, however I hope I have given you some coverage of what stage our country is currently at and what we can expect going forward. I would encourage you to do your own research to develop your own conviction. 

Would love to hear your opinions about this post and sector in the comments!

BlueStone’s IPO is all over the news, but does the hype stack up?   
  
The company’s got cool tech, its own designs, and a wide reach but let’s face it, this industry is packed with tough competition and keeping up with jewelry trends isn’t easy.

* **Profitability:** Operating Profit Margin (OPM) reached 16%, and Net Profit Margin (NPM) increased to 3.2%. Gross margins improved by 1,000 basis points YoY.
* **Asset & Debt Management:** PPE grew at a 68% CAGR; debt-to-equity ratio at 1.8. Cash conversion cycle extended to 3.6 months.
* **Manufacturing Expansion:** Current capacity at 3.5 GW, targeting 5 GW by FY25 and 10.5 GW by FY26. New facility and advanced technologies in the pipeline.

**IPO & Investment Opportunity:**

* Vikram Solar filed its DRHP with SEBI on September 30, 2024, for an IPO including fresh shares worth ₹1,500 crore and an OFS of up to 17.45 million equity shares by the promoter group. A ₹300 crore pre-IPO placement is also possible.
* The company plans to use ₹793.36 crore for a new 3 GW solar cell and module facility via VSL Green Power, and ₹602.95 crore to expand existing module capacity from 3 GW to 6 GW.
* The order book stands at 8,214.63 MW, with a target of 10.5 GW production capacity by FY26 and 15.5 GW by FY27.
* Vikram Solar has signed a retainer letter with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for $200 million in funding for its Tamil Nadu plant.

The company raised \~₹720 crore through a private placement in Q1 FY25 at a valuation of \~₹3,150 crore and may raise ₹300 crore more before the IPO, making forward EPS difficult to estimate. However, with strong sectoral tailwinds and ongoing capacity expansion, Vikram Solar’s legacy EPS is expected to experience supernormal growth in the near term, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Why I think IREDA will be a multi-bagger with 300% potential I think IREDA is a Multi-bagger stock that can grow by 300-400% in around 1-2years. Here are my reasons.

This is **not** a copy-paste, but entirely my own research. Source of most of the company data is Red Herring Prospectus available [here](https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/nov-2023/indian-renewable-energy-development-agency-limited-rhp_79087.html) but other relvent info is my personal research and understanding of the industry.

This is shared for educational purposes. Both mine and yours. I had no plans to write this, but when I researched and wrote points for my own investment, it become detailed enough that I thought of putting slightly more effort and making it into an article.

# Business model

&#x200B;

* IREDA is a central govt company made in 1987 to specifically give loans to renewable energy projects in India.
* Currently, it is the largest renewable energy financing company in India and have given out loans nearing 50000crores.
* IREDA's business is quite simple to understand yet many do not understand. They basically takes loans at 6.23% interest and then use that money to give loans to big renewable energy projects at average interest of around 10%, thus profiting 4% of everything they borrow!
* It is beneficial for companies that take these loans too as 10% is still a much lower interest rate than many other business loans from other sources. Thus win-win.
* People see the large debt and is wary of investing in a company with debt, that maybe true for normal companies but not for finance companies. Here they are all very good debt and this is exactly how all financial companies make money. More debt means more money to lend, and make more money.
* Their borrowing rate is the lowest among their peers. They borrow about half from domestic sources like RBI and bonds and the other half from foreign green investors including Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Asian Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement and the World Bank.
* The average cost of borrowing of IREDA is 6.23% in 2023. Other financing companies like REC limited have 6.96% and Power Finance Corporation Limited have 7.1% interest for the loans they borrow. Being able to borrow for such low rates, even less than Fixed-Deposits is the biggest advantage for a finance company.

&#x200B;

[The largest solar farm in the world is in Bhadla, Rajasthan. Funded partially by IREDA.](https://preview.redd.it/rpa6taypzv2c1.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c4930fab9dde7431ec802b622872eaa8233db18)

&#x200B;

# Why Low risk

# 

* Their main customers are large solar power plants and wind mills. More than 46% of their customers have made a legal agreement with the government(PPA) for the price at which govt will buy electricity from them. This is a permanent agreement that cannot be altered. This agreement was done to encourage renewable energy investments in India.
* So, a company that started in 2014 may have an agreement to sell electricity at a higher rate than a company that started in 2019 because cost of investment was higher in 2014.
* This basically guarantees profits no matter which year a renewable energy company was started as this fixed price means these solar/wind companies are guaranteed to get revenue from govt and thus guaranteed to pay their loans. There have been couple of instances of state govts wanting to get out of this agreement like in Andra Pradesh, but the govt eventually lost the case in court.
* The Andhra Pradesh high court gave order in 2022 that power contracts cannot be renegotiated and asked the state to clear dues estimated at Rs 30,000 crore to renewable energy generators in six weeks.
* But apart from that 93.4% of the loans are secured with collateral, so if the company is unable to pay in the worst case, IREDA can liquidate their collateral to recover money.
* 99.6% of the loan taking customers have taken compulsory insurance against natural disasters like Earthquake, flood, cyclone etc. So, there is no risk from disasters.
* 94.3% of the loans are given on floating interest rate, meaning the interest-payment is linked to inflation, thus there is no inflation risk to IREDA.
* 20 biggest customers account for 40% of the total loans given.
* IREDA has given loans in 23 states, so the political risk is spread across India.
* Only 1.66% of the loans given have turned out to be Non performing assets(NPAs). The net NPAs exhibited improvement, decreasing from 3.12% to 1.66% in FY23
* Out of this 1.6%, more than 70% were the loans given to Biomass plants and hydro plants, both of which were a learning experience for the company. The solar and wind are the main areas of expected growth in next 6 years, so I think NPA percentage will further come down.

&#x200B;

# Why high value

# 

* Generally, Govt PSUs are huge companies in the 50k+ range market cap. But this one is a 8k market cap company. It is basically a government startup that is in a highly lucrative field that is about to blow up.
* Government companies are generally inefficient at doing complicated projects. Like HAL has to make fighterjets. Mazagon have to make ships.  All of them are too complicated, and easy for govt company to messup. But here it is a simple business model with low number of employees required.
* They just have 175 employees, but with an average experience of 18years! Basically like a startup, but focused on one thing only.
* Government companies that has too many customers are also generally inefficient like Air India, Railways or BSNL. But, here they have one of the lowest number of customers. Thus it is easy for a govt company to manage and give good service.
* Govt is currently looking to monetize its companies and earn dividends every year. So, new guidelines says all central public sector enterprise are required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth. IREDA is a profit making company for a long time. Thus, it will give good dividend in future too.
* Govt companies generally lists showing their actual value, and is not incentivized to list at blown up valuations. Here the net worth of the company is 6,580 crore. And the market cap is 8600 crore at Rs32 per share. Considering stock market is forward looking, there is huge scope for growth.
* India has committed to make 500GW of renewable energy by 2030. That is MASSIVE. India's total energy consumption from all sources currently is for example 190GW.
* India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 70.10 GW as of July 2023
* IREDA was the financier of 22GW of renewable energy in India as of now including partially financing the largest solar power plant in the world.
* Prime minister Modi had infused 1500 crore just last year into IREDA to fast up the growth of renewable energy. This shows clear govt support for this company. But anyway my point is that 1500 crore out of 6500 crore networth of the company is direct funds from last year given for free by govt.
* Even after this IPO, 75% of the stock will still be owned by the central government, thus they are committed in the growth of this company.
* IREDA also fully owns a 50MW solar power plant in Kerala that generates 28crore per year revenue.

&#x200B;

# The current timing is awesome

&#x200B;

* 58000 crore worth of money was used to apply for IREDA IPO of just 2150 crore. Last week saw the biggest IPOs of this year. 5 IPOs that came in the week totaling 2.6lakh crore, total of 2.6lakh crore were invested. This is largest amount ever invested in a week in Indian history.
* Among these 5 stocks, IREDA will be the first to get listed, and there is  gap for others to be listed.
* More than 2.5lakh crore of this locked-up capital will be unfrozen just before IREDA is listed.
* This can cause it to show unprecedented demand when all of these people who have not got any IPO will look at buying the first IPO that got listed.
* But it will take people some time to realize this value, and stocks are forward looking, so I think in around 1-2years people will realize the potential and the price will skyrocket.
* Two years ago a similar PSU company IRFC which lends money to Railways went for IPO. It was priced at 26 rupees. But got listed at a loss of 3.5%. Its share price increase to 90 when people realized its value.
* IRFC was only subscribed 3x by QIBs. This time IREDA is 104x subscription from QIBs. There is clear interests from banks, mutual funds and govt institutions for investing in IREDA with long term view.
* IRFC lends only to railways. The scope of IREDA is substantially bigger, and is at the right time when renewable has finally become viable.
* Currently there is a trend of PSUs generally skyrocketing few years after IPO. Look at what happened to Irfc, Rvnl, IRCTC and Mazgaon.

&#x200B;

# Growth

IREDA has enough space to grow in the next 6 years. And even at 5x the IPO price, it will be a company under 50k crore market capitalization. Since stock market is forward looking, it is possible that big funds will also go long on this much before than the actual value of the company reaches there.  And the size of the company is small enough for it to get influenced by the big funds.

&#x200B;

Stock price at various Market capitalization visualization.

₹32 - 8.6k crore

₹64 - 17.2k crore

₹96 - 25.8k crore

₹128 - 34.4crore

₹160 - 43k crore

&#x200B;

This is a highly scalable data-driven business with very low risk of lending. Like, you know exactly what a solar panel will cost, and how much money it will produce over the years, so you are unlikely to give bad loans. In other financing companies, the risk is high like if you give loans to an airline or for making an ebike manufacturing factory, or give out personal loans, data is not the same for each loan-taker even in same industry. So, it is possible one ebike company makes profit while other do not. But that is not the case with solar or wind energy.

In one way I am happy I am getting to buy this stock at undervalued prices, but I am also mad at the government for selling 25% stake in such a profit making good company for loot prices. They could have got full subscription even at double the price. So, why sell low?

In general, this looks like a very good stock for long term value investing. There are so many upsides but very little downsides. I am going for long in this one.

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Waaree Energies IPO - Pros and Cons 105% GMP! 

Worth it right?

Let's also see the entire positives and negatives.

Positives:

1. Exponentially growing profits that grew more than 30 times in the last 4 years.

2. Reputed company with experienced management having more than 2 decades experience in the sector.

3. The company is at a fair valuation and about to list a PE of 33 compared to the Premier Energies which is trading at a PE of 123.

4. Solar energy sector is a rising sector with huge potential in the upcoming years and Waaree is already positioned as a leading player in the sector.

5. The company has made it clear that the proceeds from the IPO is about to be used mostly for a manufacturing facility with a capacity of 6GW

Negatives/risks:

1. India is dependent on China for solar cells and no manufacturing capacity for most of the raw materials and disruption in raw material supply or increase in pricing by Chinese companies can cause issues for the solar industry.

2. Domestic solar energy sector is dependent on government PLI schemes to run their businesses and any negative change (although highly unlikely) in the policies can impact the sector adversely.

3. Another company in the adjacent clean energy sector, MTAR Technologies, was highly dependant on Bloom Energy for it's business. When Bloom Energy's business dropped, MTAR's revenues also started falling. Although Waaree is not as concentrated in it's clients (48% of revenue is concentrated by top 5 customers), the risk needs to be reduced by diversifying significantly to other customers.

All the above mentioned risks are industry-specific risks and how it impacts the company is highly dependent on how the company handles these challenges.

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Tell me your best earning stocks in last one year and what was thought process while buying it? My Stock Market Experience

When I buy stocks, I first look at key metrics like market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and recent news, especially about new orders or developments related to the stock. After this analysis, I rely on my instincts to make a final decision. While I often make profits, there are times when I incur losses. However, over the last six months, my losses have outweighed my gains.

One stock where I had an interesting experience was Waaree Energies.

My Journey with Waaree Energies

I initially invested in this stock during its IPO. After receiving some shares in the IPO allotment, I bought additional shares on the listing day. I sold all my holdings at ₹2,500 a few days later. However, the stock rallied further to ₹3,800, leaving me regretting my early exit.

Later, when Donald Trump was elected as the U.S. President, the stock saw a downturn due to his policies. Trump frequently expressed his intent to impose duties on imports from China and India, impacting the renewable energy sector. I began buying the stock at ₹3,000, averaging down to ₹2,600, which brought my overall purchase price to ₹2,800. Eventually, I sold my holdings at ₹3,340, making a substantial profit.

Why I Chose Waaree Energies

I was exploring renewable energy stocks because of the increasing adoption of solar panels in households. The Indian government provides a ₹78,000 subsidy under the PM Suryaghar Yojana for installing household solar systems, which has boosted demand.

Despite some concerns over the stock’s valuation, I believed in Waaree because it has the largest solar module manufacturing capacity in India. My bet paid off.

An Important Learning

While I profited, I discovered that Waaree primarily generates revenue through exports rather than domestic household solar installations. This is because the government subsidy of ₹78,000 applies only to solar systems that comply with Domestic Content Requirements (DCR). When I explored installing a solar system for my household, I was surprised that the installer did not have Waaree panels. Despite being a market leader, Waaree did not have DCR-compliant panels in the widely preferred N-type TOPCon bifacial technology.

Currently, Waaree has introduced DCR-compliant panels but still lags in some advanced technologies. I believe the company will eventually produce the best panels in the industry. If the government relaxes DCR compliance rules, Waaree’s stock price could skyrocket.

My Current Outlook

The recent sell-off in Waaree’s stock has created another potential buying opportunity. I’m considering reinvesting in the company as I foresee strong growth in the renewable energy sector.

I've done a thorough analysis of all listed solar ( Module+ Cell) Manufacturers.

Above date represents current capcaties and guidance by management in term so capacity installation .

**Target Capacity**: Indian Govt's aggressive target to achieve 280 GW of solar power capacity by 2030, forming a major component of the broader goal to reach 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy

**Current Status**: As of 2025, India has installed over 119 GW of solar capacity

**ALMM (Approved List of Models and Manufacturers)**

* **Effective from April 1, 2024**, the ALMM mandates that all government-assisted or -associated solar projects must use only modules from the approved list. This effectively excludes many imported modules, particularly from countries like China, creating a non-tariff barrier for foreign products.
* **Domestic Boost**: The policy aims to bolster domestic solar module manufacturers by ensuring a substantial market share in government-backed projects
* **Future Plans**: The government has proposed adding solar wafers to the ALMM list by June 2028, further strengthening the domestic supply chain

# ALCM (Approved List of Cell Manufacturers)

* **Implementation Timeline**: The ALCM is set to become mandatory from June 1, 2026. This will require solar projects to source cells only from manufacturers listed in the approved list
* **Domestic Manufacturing Focus**: The ALCM aims to promote domestic production of solar cells, reducing reliance on imports and enhancing energy security

  
Although this looks like a solar boom we're currently experiencing , by end of 2030 only players who look to survive are with backward integration ( Cell manufacturing , ingots , wafers )

As always , enter at right valuations and exit when the story seems over ( Overcapacities in this case)

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Thoughts on Waaree Energies IPO? If I get the allotment, I plan to invest a lot of my capital in Waaree Energies IPO. 

Previously, I applied for Premier Energies and I'm at 140% gains.

But now I plan to sell some of Waaree Energies lots during the listing, to get some listing gains.

Need your thoughts on this.

My analysis so far:  
The company plans to utilize the funds raised from the IPO (Fresh Issue) primarily for two purposes:

1. **Establishing a Manufacturing Facility**: The proceeds will partly finance the cost of establishing a 6GW manufacturing facility for ingot wafer, solar cell, and solar PV module production in Odisha, India. The estimated amount allocated for this purpose from the net proceeds is ₹25,000 million.
2. **General Corporate Purposes**: A portion of the funds will be allocated to general corporate purposes, although the specific amount will be finalized based on the offer price.

The company plans to use approximately 83.3% of the net proceeds from the IPO to establish the manufacturing facility in Odisha.

The total issue size of Waaree Energies Limited's IPO is up to ₹30,000 million, which includes:

1. **Fresh Issue**: Up to ₹30,000 million, which will be used for funding the manufacturing facility and general corporate purposes.
2. **Offer for Sale (OFS)**: In addition, up to 3,200,000 equity shares will be offered by the selling shareholders, though the exact amount from the OFS isn't specified yet​

Now, comparing the IPO Use of Proceeds between Premier Energies and Waaree Energies:

* **Premier Energies Limited**:
   * **Total Fresh Issue Amount**: ₹15,000 million.
   * **Primary Use**: Establishment of a 4 GW Solar PV TOPCon Cell and 4 GW Solar PV TOPCon Module manufacturing facility in Hyderabad, Telangana.
   * **Percentage Allocation**: The entire net proceeds from the Fresh Issue are planned to be directed towards setting up the manufacturing facility and general corporate purposes. Of the total amount, approximately 77.9% (₹11,687.38 million out of ₹15,000 million) will be used to part-finance the facility​.
* **Waaree Energies Limited**:
   * **Total Fresh Issue Amount**: ₹30,000 million.
   * **Primary Use**: Establishment of a 6 GW integrated manufacturing facility for ingot wafer, solar cell, and solar PV modules in Odisha, India.
   * **Percentage Allocation**: About 83.3% of the net proceeds (₹25,000 million out of ₹30,000 million) will be allocated for setting up the new facility​

Waaree Energies Limited plans to invest a higher amount (₹25,000 million) in its new facility compared to Premier Energies Limited's planned investment of ₹11,687.38 million. Additionally, Waaree's use of proceeds for setting up the facility comprises a larger percentage of the total fresh issue proceeds than Premier Energies. Therefore, Waaree Energies Limited is planning to do more in terms of total investment from IPO funds.",1729344588.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g78yd9/thoughts_on_waaree_energies_ipo/

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Waaree Energies Ltd Unlisted Shares FY24 Results and Business Update
 **Waaree Energies Ltd, India's largest solar module manufacturer, delivered robust financial and operational results for FY24, marking another year of significant growth and strategic progress.**

The company reported an impressive **68.8% year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenue from operations**, reaching ₹1,13,976.09 million for FY24. This surge in revenue was complemented by a remarkable **154% YoY growth in profit after tax (PAT)**, which soared to ₹12,743.77 million. Waaree’s expansion into various verticals of the solar energy business, along with its strategic focus on exports, contributed significantly to these results.

Waaree Energies has maintained a strong foothold in the market with its **12 GW solar module manufacturing capacity**, which positions it as a leader in India's renewable energy sector. During FY24, the company executed **704 MWp of EPC projects** and managed a portfolio of **over 500 MWp in operations and maintenance (O&M)** services, further highlighting its execution capabilities.

The company’s order book stood strong at **19,928.12 MW** as of March 31, 2024, demonstrating its ability to attract substantial contracts. Moreover, Waaree is focusing on expanding its capacity, aiming to establish **21 GW of solar cell capacity** and **11.4 GW of ingot-wafer capacity** by FY26-27. This includes the commissioning of a **6 GW fully integrated facility** for the production of ingots, wafers, solar cells, and modules in Odisha, along with 1.6 GW of capacity in the United States, solidifying its global expansion ambitions.

# Business Strategy and Growth

Waaree’s strategy revolves around capacity expansion, operational excellence, and international growth. The company’s plans to commission **5.4 GW of additional solar cell capacity by FY24-25** are a critical component of its roadmap for growth. Waaree’s ongoing efforts to increase its U.S. manufacturing presence, with a **3 GW facility under development**, showcase its strategic intent to tap into global markets, especially in regions like the U.S. where solar demand is rising.

Export sales, particularly to the U.S., have become a dominant revenue stream for the company. In the first quarter of FY24 alone, exports accounted for **73% of total revenue**, with the U.S. contributing a substantial **65%** of the company’s revenues. Waaree's increasing reliance on international markets does pose potential risks, particularly with regard to fluctuating demand and policy changes in the U.S. However, the company’s leadership in innovation, cost-efficiency, and capacity expansion across markets positions it well to mitigate these risks.

**Retail sales**, although a smaller part of Waaree’s overall business (contributing **9.96% to total revenue in FY23**), continue to grow, supported by programs like the **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana**. However, this vertical is largely concentrated in Gujarat, and any adverse demand fluctuations from this region could impact Waaree’s business.

# IPO Update: A Key Milestone

Waaree Energies Ltd is gearing up for its **initial public offering (IPO)**, which is expected to launch in **mid-October 2024**, according to recent updates. The IPO is projected to raise **₹3,000 crore** through a combination of fresh equity and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to **32 lakh shares**. The company received regulatory approval for its IPO on September 20, 2024, and has outlined its plans to use the proceeds for capacity expansion and general corporate purposes.

A significant portion of the funds raised will be utilized to establish a **6 GW ingot-wafer, solar cell, and module manufacturing facility in Odisha**, further bolstering Waaree’s production capacity. The OFS includes shares from promoter entities such as **Waaree Sustainable Finance Private Limited** and **Chandurkar Investments**, as well as shares from individual shareholders like **Samir Surendra Shah**.

The company's **aggregate installed capacity of 12 GW** as of June 2023, and its strategic focus on the U.S. market and retail expansion, provide a compelling investment thesis for potential investors. Additionally, Waaree’s financial performance, with **revenues more than doubling from FY22 to FY23** (from ₹2,854 crore to ₹6,750 crore), and a **nearly five-fold increase in PAT**, showcases the company’s growth trajectory and financial resilience.

# Challenges and Risks

Despite its impressive financial performance, Waaree faces several challenges. The company’s **heavy reliance on the U.S. market** for revenue presents risks associated with geopolitical and trade uncertainties. In FY24, **76.11% of its revenue came from just 10 customers**, with its largest customer contributing 20% of total revenue, signaling high customer concentration risk.

Additionally, Waaree’s expansion into retail, particularly in Gujarat, exposes it to regional demand fluctuations. Moreover, the company’s ability to execute its U.S. capacity expansion will be crucial in determining its future growth trajectory, and any delays or inefficiencies could impact its financial performance.

# Conclusion

Waaree Energies Ltd has delivered an outstanding performance in FY24, marked by substantial revenue and profit growth, a robust order book, and ongoing expansion in manufacturing capacity. With its IPO set for mid-October 2024, the company is poised to scale new heights, driven by strategic investments in both domestic and international markets. However, navigating risks such as export dependency and customer concentration will be critical to sustaining its growth momentum in the years ahead.  
  
As of FY24, Waaree's **EPS stands at ₹48.05 per share**, implying that the company's shares are trading at a **fair value of \~60 P/E** presenting a lucrative investment opportunity.

Working capital needs 84cr  


**Business**  


Aeroflex industries, **started in 1993**, produces **metallic flexible flow solution products**  like  solar hoses, gas hoses, vacuum hoses, braided hoses, exhaust connectors, exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR) tubes,  expansion bellows.  
Company is **mainly export oriented business, exporting to 80 countries. Exports constitute 81% of revenues. (28% US)**  
These products play a critical role in transfer of air, liquid and solid in any industrial applications. 

Used in **Chemical plants, Oil refineries, Petrochemicals, Steel plants, Power plants**, Bulk material handling, Natural Gas transfer, Water treatment plants, HVAC systems.  


Lone manufacturing facility is at Navi Mumbai with a total capacity of 11 million meters/ year.

&#x200B;

**Financials**

 

Annual revenues 270cr. PAT 30cr.  
Revenue from operations grew at 36% CAGR, EBITDA grew at 55% CAGR, PAT at 124% from F21 to F23.

**Profits have become 5X in last 2 years.**  
EBITDA margins expanded from 15% to 20% in 2 years.

ROCE at healthy 31%, increased .  
**Capacity utilization is 83%** which is good.  
There are no listed peers in India with whom its performance can be compared

  
 

**Points to consider**  


Though  Stainless steel pipes are very much advantageous over rubber /polymer  hose, the latter is relatively cheaper which makes cost-conscious  customers tilting towards it.  
Industry has high entry barrier in terms of requirement of R&D capabilities.  
Raw materials are stainless steel ( sourced mainly from outside) which are **subject to  steel price fluctuations.**  
**They  purchase raw material under short term contracts, sourced mainly from  China. For end products too, they don't have any long term contracts  with any customers.**  
80% of revenues are dependent on exports , though diversified , except for only US (28%).  
**Dependence on single manufacturing unit** is a kind of risk.

  
Business requires high inventory , contributing 30-40% of revenues. 84cr coming from IPO will suffice for near term.  


Company is already operating at **high  capacity utilization of 83-90% , but not yet disclosed any expansion  plans which they will require for growing revenues at high pace. They  will need to raise debt for that.**

Metal products – manufacturing of kitchen utensils and home ware – is the largest end use of stainless-steel  


**SS Finishing sheet**  
Key segments that are driving the demand for SS sheets are Architecture, Building & Construction (ABC) and Automotive, Railway & Transport (ART). In ABC, the usage is primarily on roofing and cladding and in elevators & escalators .

Inventory is 205cr. Quite high.  
Trade receivables not that high.  
negative cashflow from operations. 

&#x200B;

 

**Points to consider**  


It needs to be seen if Ratnaveer can  benefit from demand from railway coaches and metro coaches, otherwise other demand drivers of SS finishing sheet ( their main product) are aesthetic and decorative in nature.  


Industry does not have any pricing power, the lowest cost producer wins. Further dependent on steel price fluctuations.  


50% of revenues come from top 10 customers, so there is very high customer concentration.

Under the new management, apart from adding different form of engagements (becoming IP based – turnkey solutions) they have expanded to different states and have been bagging contracts consistently from there.

India’s discount brokerage party seems to be slowing down and fast.

In the September 2025 quarter alone, over 26 lakh active clients vanished from discount brokerages. That’s almost half the total attrition for the entire year so far  roughly 50 lakh users gone in 9 months.

Even the big four  Groww, Zerodha, Angel One, and Upstox  felt the heat. Together, they made up 75% of the total decline.

Groww lost 6.7 lakh clients

Zerodha: 5 lakh

Angel One: 4.3 lakh

Upstox: 3 lakh.

The slowdown mirrors what’s happening in the markets  weaker corporate earnings, foreign outflows, and dull IPO listings(apart from LG) have dented retail enthusiasm. Sensex and Nifty both slipped around 4% this quarter, and the volatility seems to have scared off short-term traders.

Interestingly, a few smaller names Paytm Money, SBICap, and ICICI Securities actually gained clients, proving there’s still life left in the market… just shifting hands.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Rajkot collapsed Hyundai IPO I always wanted to get into Gujarati circles to know more about stock investing but seeing the level of stock market involvement in Gujarat has piqued my interest even more.

Rajkot, a tier-2 city in Gujarat, wrote the fate of India's biggest IPO to date.

Interestingly, Rajkot is India's third-largest source of IPO applications. This is comparable to the level of involvement seen in a city as big as Mumbai (the financial capital of India), despite having only 10% of Mumbai's population.

But that is not all. Rajkot also has a high participation through the grey market, which has influenced Hyundai's GMP. GMP is the number #1 factor that retail investors take into account before applying for an IPO.

Companies make a sales pitch of their IPOs (through roadshows) to potential investors, brokers, and media houses to create hype. The roadshow circuits of IPO-bound companies focus on big cities, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, and a small, seemingly ""out of place"" city Rajkot.

But this seemingly ""out of place"" city has to show interest in the grey market for the GMP to go up, thereby deciding the outcome of the IPO.

Investors of Rajkot did not show much interest in the Hyundai IPO. The city, with its stock market culture and seasoned share brokers, is an important hub for the IPO grey market. Rajkot was supposedly a big IPO hub even back in the 1990s. Hyundai Motors GMP tanked day by day and a large part of this is due to disinterest from the city having the third-highest number of IPO applicants.

In contrast, investors from the city showed interest in Waaree Energies IPO and the GMP went up by crazy margins. Surprising right? That investors from a tier-2 city can influence retail investors throughout the country when they decide not to invest in a particular IPO.

Now after this observation, I remember my hunch about the Hyundai IPO GMP deliberately being bought down so that some large players can buy a fundamentally good company at a cheap valuation (by reducing competition during IPO). But my theory might also have some loopholes since this was only a casual observation.

Came across this interesting piece in the paper today. It talks about blending a regular SIP strategy with occasional dip-buying using ETFs, especially when markets drop sharply (say more than 1%).

The idea is that while SIPs bring in discipline, dip-buying adds that tactical edge during corrections—if done calmly and with proper planning. They even mention setting aside 5–10% of your allocation just for such dips.

But the cold truth is the IPO was overpriced (similar to LIC, in fact even worse) and retail subscription was only 50%.

Financially strong company, brand reputation, global player. None of it mattered since the company did not make it clear if the proceeds will be invested in Indian arm of the company and people can only assume where will their money go once the South Korean promoters pocket it.

Retail investors might have seen only the GMP without seeing the other factors mentioned above but they have indeed saved themselves from the disappointment when the listing happens and see their holdings in red.

Also anyway mutual fund houses would have indirectly deployed retailers money in the IPO, which was unavoidable.

**Points to consider**  
  
  
Top 5 states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telengana, Gujarat, Delhi constitute 85% of AUM, any adverse calamity in these states would negatively affect the company.  
  
Large exposure in residential and commercial real estate hence any downturn in this sector might affect Bajaj housing finance negatively.  
  
As it is non-deposit taking NBFCs, it relies on borrowings and hence any impact on interest rate might affect them negatively. 44% of borrowings are at fixed interest rates, 56% of borrowings at floating interest rates whereas 99.8% of loans advanced are in floating interest rates.  
  
Their key business strengths lie in strong parentage , diversified funding sources , vast network and risk management (one of the best HFC’s in capital & profitability ratios).  
  
Bajaj finance holds 100% of BHFL, wherein just 1 year before RHP filing they invested approx Rs 2,000 cr as an equity by acquiring 110,74,19,709 shares at Rs 18.1  
  
Average ticket size being 46 lakhs, BHFL caters to premium housing customers, which is growing at 13-15% CAGR. Also it is easy to lend being high ticket vs Affordable housing finance cos with 10 lakh ticket size.  
  
BHFL has grown at stellar speed, just in 8 years AUM of 97000cr, last 2 year AUM CAGR of 31% and PAT CAGR of 56%- all because of huge customer database of Bajaj Finance. It is said data is the most important moat for Bajaj Finance.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"SEBI NSE deal is a blatant loot of retailers NSE has proposed 1400 crore  settlement with SEBI to shut all investigations against it for richest India Inc's [ 62(?) stock brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) priority preferential colocation - private colocation = 10 lakh per rack per year,  and dark fibre connections providing early access, thus failing to provide equitable access to all its trading members thereby trying to whitewash the biggest government assisted fraud - Scam 2010 ( may be next sequel ) - in Indian history which produced unworthy billionaires at cost of gullible retailers, using one or more leased line from any of the four service providers - MTNL, TATA, Reliance and Bharti and one unauthorized Sampark Infotainment - NSE/MEM/12985 to facilitate better access to Direct Market Access (DMA) and algorithmic trading..... in 2009-10!

The scale of this settlement reveals the enormous profits generated through privileged order flow access, early order detection and front-running capabilities granted to a handful of players. Many Nifty 50 companies' liquidity appears sustained by capital accumulated through these questionable practices over the past decade, while retail investors bore the costs through [brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) that facilitated this unequal system.

With only token actions taken against CNBC/ET Now tipster Gift City based IIFL Securities' director Sanjiv Bhasin or index banks like IndusInd Bank, ICICI , RHFL etc ( a long list ) this precedent risks further entrenching the advantage of sophisticated algorithmic traders (like Jane Street's GPU-based systems), potentially eliminating any remaining non-algo participants.

Instead of permitting alleged manipulation profits to remain concentrated among privileged market players, shouldn't regulatory mechanisms be established to compensate defrauded traders? This could take the form of direct restitution or tax relief measures - rather than continuing a system that has disproportionately benefited select entities for decades.

The current settlement attempts to whitewash what may represent one of India's most significant financial scandals - one that has enriched both corporate and political interests through systematic market advantages. Now, these same patterns risk being perpetuated through new AI-driven trading systems that provide even greater opacity and deniability.

This raises fundamental questions about our judicial system's ability to address such complex financial crimes in a timely manner - whether examining the 7-year deliberation on electoral bonds, Justice Varma's proceedings, or the stalled Boeing investigations. The systemic delays and loopholes suggest institutional frameworks remain ill-equipped to confront modern financial engineering, leaving retail investors perpetually vulnerable.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Kalyan jewellers - a overhated but interesting stock Before I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news 

Over the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) 

The allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered 


Now you may say ""you are biased cause you hold it"" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait


Now onto the allegations -

1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way

2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false

3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars

4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos 😂 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case

5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange 


The overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market 


About corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class
The chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me

It's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest



This also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab
Polycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis 
I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG
Now the rest readers can take it as it may
I haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it

I remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say ""don't compare it to titan"" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims
Data doesn't lie nor does factual information,
 Good luck investing and take care",1737178172.0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i40mpb/kalyan_jewellers_a_overhated_but_interesting_stock/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"NTPC Green Energy IPO analysis and verdict **1. Company fundamentals**

NTPC Green Energy Limited is owned by NTPC Limited. It is India's largest power generation company. The company has a lot of positives such as:

**Strong Parentage:** Company is backed by NTPC Limited, a state-owned enterprise, which provides NTPC Green with financial stability and access to resources.

**Company Growth:** NTPC Green Energy has seen a revenue growth rate of 46.82%, increasing from ₹910.42 crore in FY 2022 to ₹1,962.60 crore in FY 2024. The profit after tax has been growing at a CAGR of 90.75%, increasing from ₹94.74 crore in FY 2022 to ₹344.72 crore in FY 2024.

**Government Support:** The Indian government's emphasis on renewable energy and policies such as 24x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, PLI schemes and multiple green energy schemes can benefit NTPC Green.

2. **Issue size and split**

The size of the IPO is Rs. 10000 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,904 for retail investors.

The NTPC Green Energy IPO is a **purely fresh issue**, meaning there is **no Offer For Sale (OFS)** component. This is a huge green flag since we know that all proceeds from the IPO will go directly to the company and will not be cashed out by existing promoters.

3. **Brand name and experienced Management**

As mentioned earlier, the company is a subsidiary of state-owned NTPC Ltd. The key management team is experienced and has good expertise in the power sector.

The management is led by CEO Mr. Rajiv Gupta, CFO Mr. Neeraj Sharma and company secretary Mr. Manish Kumar.

4. **Valuation**

NTPC Green is aiming for a valuation of around $12 billion, which is one of the biggest valuations in the renewable energy sector.

The company's PE ratio of 148 is higher than its smaller peers but is lesser than its bigger rival Adani Green Energy's PE ratio of 260. The valuation is considered reasonable, given the company's strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and the government's push for renewable energy.

5. **Clear Use of Proceeds**

The company proposes to use the proceeds from the IPO towards investment in the wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL), for repay debts of subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy and the remaining for general corporate purposes.

While this may raise questions among investors, repayment of debts also comes with positives such as reduced loans, reduce in interest outflow for company and increase in profits after tax (PAT).

6. **Strong underwriting team**

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

The book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are IDBI Capital Market Services Limited, HDFC Bank Limited, IIFL Securities Ltd and Nuvama Wealth Management Limited. The issue's registrar is Kfin Technologies Limited.

7. **QIB subscription**

When the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company. So observe the QIB subscription numbers throughout all 3 days of the IPO.

**Verdict**

This IPO is mostly positive, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.",1731744514.0,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gsiqni/ntpc_green_energy_ipo_analysis_and_verdict/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"IPO Application Rejections IPO Application Rejections – Need Clarity on New SEBI Rules

I’ve been applying for IPOs for the past 2 years using multiple demat accounts (friends/family) to increase allotment chances. Each account applies only once for an IPO, but for payment blocking I always use my own personal UPI ID.

I was getting allotments normally (last successful one was HDB Financial). But after that, every IPO application started getting rejected—even in cases where retail had a 1/1 allotment ratio. Payment requests came and were accepted, but allotment status was always “Not Allotted.”

When I checked in Angel One, it said:

> ""No shares allotted as your application has been rejected by the registrar since you applied for 2 or more applications with the same PAN card, which is not allowed. Banks usually take 4-7 days to unblock your funds.""

This confused me because I’m not using the same PAN for multiple applications—only the same UPI ID. I contacted Zerodha and Angel, and both said SEBI now requires that all details (PAN, bank account, UPI, etc.) must belong to the same person as the demat account holder.

I couldn’t find much about this online. My question:

Is this a real SEBI rule or just broker misinformation?

If yes, why did I get allotments for 2 years with the same process but now suddenly rejections?

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"IPO reservations in India I recently got to know that India is one of the few countries (whose securities exchange) that mandates a certain portion of the IPOs must go to retail. I assumed that this was the norm across the world. In fact, at least 35% of each IPO must go to the public, which is significantly higher than any other country (that I could find). 

While there is certain benefit to the companies with this structure by diluting the ownership, it is implemented by SEBI to benefit the public. If there was no cap on how much institutional investors could buy up, the public would never be able to get any shares from the IPO. SEBI reserves 35% of the offering for the retailers like you and me so that we can benefit from the company’s growth. This reservation levels the playing field a little so that the profits trickle down to the common public more directly.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"IPO debacle and lessons learnt from it The recent Wework India IPO was a disaster in the making from the very beginning. As was expected, the listing gain was negative 2% today. Probably one of the worst IPOs Indian Stock Market has seen in this year. The company priced its shares too high, there were governance issues and promoters were embroiled in legal battles. All in all the long term viability of this company is seriously questionable. With losses in balance sheet, any analyst will instantly come to know that this IPO is not to make money but to offload risk.

I have come across several observations regarding such poor IPOs - 

  
1) IPOs have Book running lead managers (BRLMs) who function as not only agents of the company on stock exchanges but also perform the function of underwriting any risks related to the IPO.

  
2) BRLMs for wework india IPO were - JM Financials, ICICI Securities, Jefferies, Kotak Mahindra Capital and 360 one WAM. These BRLMs have been highly aggressive in listing companies on mainboard. 

  
3) Anchor Investors for the IPO were [these](https://www.chittorgarh.net/reports/anchor-investor/wework-india-intimation_anchor-allocation_wework.pdf).   
  
(To name a few - ICICI PRUDENTIAL TECHNOLOGY FUND, HDFC MUTUAL FUND - HDFC BUSINESS CYCLE FUND, HDFC MUTUAL FUND - HDFC INNOVATION FUND ,HDFC VALUE FUND, HDFC TRUSTEE COMPANY LTD, HDFC BALANCED ADVANTAGE FUND.)  
  
Anchor investors were subsidiaries of these BRLMs or their associate. It's clear that underwriters themselves asked their sister concerns to invest in this IPO. 

  
4) This is not the first time this has happened. [Ceigall India IPO](https://www.chittorgarh.net/reports/anchor-investor/ceigall_anchor_allocation_report.pdf) experienced something similar. My investment has almost halved from Rs 400 to cmp Rs 250 because I bought that company for long term, seeing the confidence of these big names as anchor investors in that IPO too. And guess who the underwriters in that offer were - ICICI Securities, JM Financial and same registrar MUFG Intime.  

What I learnt from it? 

1. There is clear conflict of interest when underwriter is himself the buyer.

What they have done is actually rigged the game well in advance -

* set the price band,
* Underwrite the issue (and must fill shortfall if undersubscribed),
* Invested in it themselves -  with **client (mutual fund) money**, not their own.

That’s not a vote of confidence, it’s **self-dealing** under the guise of “institutional support.”

2) BRLMs saved the IPO from getting cancelled as retail interest in these companies has been extremely inadequate. Meaning there must have been intense back channeling and kickbacks to fund managers to invest in these kind of IPOs.

3) AMCs have a fiduciary responsibility above all else. They can make any bids and take any risk as long as it is in concurrence with SEBI guidelines but when it is such a clear case of a poor company, the AMCs have literally, resorted to gambling, if not bribery. If their due diligence was so poor that they invested in such companies with poor financials, it raises serious doubts about the integrity and trust on the fund houses. 

4) Mutual Funds Sahi Hai? They handle such large amounts of assets that someone is bound to get greedy. With disclosures only mandated to monthly frequency, whatever they do with the money in the meantime is a black box, nobody knows.

5) As a corollary to my previous point, the huge amounts of assets under management with Mutual Funds, it makes it harder for their mistakes to come to the fore. But remember it's the compounding of small mistakes that brings down the house of cards, similar to what happened in 2008 crash.

6) IPOs are all about risk management and never about money for AMCs. Mutual Funds have a responsibility of safeguarding their client's money above all else. By taking on such risks they are just skirting on the edge of laws. Nobody can legally challenge their acquisition of IPO because it is well within the law but all these points about conflict of interest, rigging the game, fiduciary responsibility, transparency and ethics, assume a higher meaning when you become the backbone of our country's financial stability. 

Someone needed to drop this truth bomb and I hope investors of these AMCs, question these fund houses on their decision to bid in these poor IPOs. For such smart people that we Indians are, it comes as a shock to me how ignorant people can be when it comes to eliciting answers from faceless organisations. Nobody questions AMCs on their practices and their bad decisions.",1760111919.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1o34vly/ipo_debacle_and_lessons_learnt_from_it/

Later I stopped because of low allotment chances, more demat AC requirements & funds were diverted.

🚴started june-23 under 'company name' you can see i Invested in these 28 in 1 year. Used to skip the one which I didn't felt confident.

📊 The Strategy was simple I new that in retail segment oversubscription wouldn't exceed 4-7x, if (GMP is 20-50%)
(Issue size 500-800cr) & (Shares offered is 35%). On an average i used to apply with 5-7 demat AC, 2 A/c were mine others are of my friends I used to give them funds to invest in IPOs in return I provided them fixed commission pretty cool deal.

💸In further columns those are Gain & loss. Losses were small profits were huge. Under investment column those are the maximum investment which I made per IPO. Used to invest heavily where oversubscription were 100%. Beside it I have noted some data points of every IPO later on i stopped reporting it.


🔥In the month of Nov i made almost 45k. Tata tech was purely luck based 😅 wasn't expected, booked 170% gains. After that every Indian flocked to IPO markets IREDA,TATA were making headlines. Even on a decent IPO oversubscriptions in retail segments were going crazy 8-12X whereas HNI category was normal. Allotment chances got harder and harder to counter that I planned to add more no. Of demat A/c. But that also didn't worked coz
 subscription went 15-18x. Me and our traders friends were eagerly waiting for that 1 bad IPO.   So these new entrants could get a lesson.

🥳Nonetheless I made 1.30 L  from IPO shuffling & another 15k from investments leftover in IPO stock later sold at profit. Around 20k invested.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Before you jump into Tata Capital IPO. Please read this. The Tata Capital IPO is set to launch on October 6, 2025, and will close on October 8, 2025. The listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) is scheduled for October 13, 2025. This ₹15,511.87 crore issue includes a fresh issue of ₹6,846 crore and an offer for sale of ₹8,665.87 crore. The price band has been set between ₹310 and ₹326 per share, with a minimum lot size of 46 shares, translating to an investment of approximately ₹14,996 for retail investors. 


ANALYSIS
The Tata brand is strong, but here’s a closer look at the numbers:

•Profits: FY23 showed a high profit (~₹7,000cr), largely from a one-time gain. Core earnings come from interest on loans and fees, which are sensitive to RBI rate changes.

•Debt profile: Borrowings are significant. The housing finance subsidiary (TCHFL) has around 7% non-performing loans, compared with 1.9% overall.

•Cash flow: Free cash flow from core operations is modest. Provisions for bad loans fluctuate year-on-year, reflecting the nature of lending business.

•Key ratios: Capital adequacy is 16.9% (vs peers like Bajaj Finance at 21.9%). Provision coverage ratio has decreased from 74% → 58%. Return on equity was boosted by the one-time gain.

•Valuation: This is the company’s first IPO, so no prior stock performance. Employee stock options are high, which could dilute future shareholder value. Some assets use Level 3 valuation models, which are less transparent.

•Legal & tax matters: Tata Capital and its 
subsidiaries are involved in ~12,000 ongoing cases, including tax disputes worth ~₹5,600cr, consumer complaints, and borrower-related matters.

•Governance: The board largely consists of Tata insiders. There are risk committees, though subsidiaries continue to carry higher exposures.

Final take- Tata Capital combines a trusted brand and scale with certain financial and operational risks. Understanding the debt structure, subsidiary performance, and ongoing legal matters can help potential investors make an informed decision.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"fucking system is corrupt. Why Are Big Players Dominate SME IPOs? The SHNI Allotment Rule Needs to Change! 😡 please read it fully.

*Disclaimer: To save time, I made this post with the help of ChatGPT. These may not be my exact words, but the information provided is 100% accurate. If I’m missing something here, please help me understand this rule. I’ve chosen a more aggressive tone to reach more people and bring awareness to this garbage rule.*

Alright, it’s time someone called this out. The way SME IPO allotments work in the SHNI category is rigged in favor of fat-wallet investors, and it's beyond frustrating. If you don’t have ₹7 crore for {LAKSHYA POWERTECH } and 1.5 crore for {SHIVTEXCHEM} to throw around, just forget about getting an allotment when things are oversubscribed. And why? Because these **SHNI rules are outdated and shamelessly cater to those big players**, letting them hoard shares while average investors get nothing.

Here’s what’s happening: In the SHNI category, they use a **proportionate allotment** system, which sounds fair but actually just rewards those with massive applications. So, if you’re a regular investor applying for fewer shares, good luck. You’re competing against the sharks who’ll eat up the whole IPO because they can throw more money at it. This system needs a serious overhaul, and regulators like **SEBI should quit pandering to these big-money bullies** and start thinking about fairness.

**Why This Is Messed Up:**

1. **Fair Chance for Everyone? Total Lie.** When oversubscription happens, SHNI applicants should get random allotments like retail investors, plain and simple. But no, they let the big players walk away with guaranteed shares. Retail investors get randomized allotments when there’s high demand—why are SHNI investors any different?
2. **Leveling the Playing Field? Not Even Close.** Right now, SHNI rules just tell the average investor to “get lost” if they can’t pony up a fortune. You’d think IPOs would be about broad participation, but clearly, it’s just about sucking up to those who already have deep pockets.
3. **SEBI, Wake Up Already!** SEBI should be protecting us, the real investors, not catering to people who just keep inflating their piles of cash. It’s time SEBI got serious about fixing these allotment rules. SME IPOs should distribute shares fairly and not hand them over on a silver platter to the highest bidder.

**Final Thoughts:** This rule for SHNI allotments in oversubscribed IPOs is plain wrong, and SEBI needs to **grow a backbone and fix this mess**. Randomized allotment is long overdue, especially when demand skyrockets.

And here’s the kicker: even if these big players manage to secure, say, 20 SME allotments in a year, that’s nothing compared to the SME IPOs out there. Assuming the average size is ₹2.5 lakh and GMP is around 100%, they’re sitting on a cool ₹50 lakh profit *for the year*. They’re **raking it in** while the rest of us get scraps.

I have only analysed this two SME IPOs and found this and I am pretty much sure that this will follow in all SME IPOs and my mind is not believing just look at the allotment ration in the SHNI category and I feel like we guys just have to do something to make it more fairer I feel like its cheating to small people like me who just pray all days to god to get allotment but rules are really fucked up or else I am mad please help me to understand this and last thing if we check this for the mainstream IPOs this is not the case its totally based on the lottery system.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"$TDIC squeeze potential after $BYND # 🚀 **$TDIC Investment Thesis: Low Float, 70%+ Insider Owned, Short Squeeze Setup?** 🚀

**Dreamland Limited ($TDIC)** - Hong Kong event management company that IPO'd July 23, 2025. Traded **above $7** recently but got **hammered by shorts** to **~$0.61**. Low float + locked insider shares = **potential squeeze play**. Here's why I'm bullish:

---

## 📊 **Key Stats**
| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Insider Ownership** | **70.79-71.73%** (CEO Wai Yue Seto owns ~71.7%) |
| **Public Float** | **~8.76M shares** (out of 31M total) |
| **Short Interest** | **0.24-0.27%** (21.3K shares) |
| **Lock-up Expires** | **~Jan 19, 2026** (180 days from IPO) |
| **Recent High/Low** | **$6.75 → $0.61** |

---

## 💎 **Why Buy $TDIC Now?**

### 1️⃣ **INSIDER SKIN IN THE GAME**
- **70%+ owned by insiders** - they ain't selling anytime soon
- **Lock-up until Jan 2026** = no immediate dump risk from big holders
- Management aligned with shareholders

### 2️⃣ **LOW FLOAT = HIGH VOLATILITY**
- **8.76M float** = tiny supply for explosive moves
- Even modest buying volume can spike this hard
- **Short squeeze potential** if shorts pile in (currently low but could change)

### 3️⃣ **OVERSOLD AFTER SHORT ATTACK**
- Dropped from **$7+ to $0.61** on post-IPO selling + short pressure
- **Events industry recovering** - Hong Kong tourism booming
- Trading at **depressed levels** vs IPO valuation

### 4️⃣ **SQUEEZE CATALYSTS**
- **Low short interest** + **low float** = perfect setup
- **Upcoming earnings** could flip sentiment
- Social media buzz could ignite retail interest

---

## 🔥 **THE PLAY**
- **Entry**: ~$0.61 (current levels)
- **Target**: $3-5 short-term, $7+ if squeeze hits
- **Stop**: $0.40 (tight risk management)

**Float too small, insiders too locked, shorts too cocky.** This smells like a **classic squeeze setup**.

---

## ⚠️ **RISKS**
- **High volatility** - can drop further
- **Illiquid** - wide spreads, hard to exit
- **Events sector sensitive** to economy/regs
- **Geopolitical** Hong Kong risks

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"4 years of applying to IPOs, taking out the principal, and keeping the profits for life. Current value of those profits: ~450k This is a follow-up to my [2024 post on another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1etkbad/3_years_of_applying_to_ipos_taking_out_the/).

I have been subscribing to IPOs (retail only) since 2021 and since the start I fixed the strategy: exit on listing regardless of the outcome. Take out the principal and keep the profit for lifetime. 

I have to admit I have deviated from that rule since last year and I have kept stocks like Tata Capital, Tata Tech, Bajaj HFL, etc. This is because I feel they'll do better in the long run. The Hyundai holding was an error and it proved good and so did the lone Kalpataru share.

I have 3 retail accounts (across me and my immediate family), so the first 3 images are from my family holdings. These demat accounts are only for IPOs, save the SETNIF50 holding you see in an image.

I do top-level research to form an opinion on all IPOs but over these 4 years, I have seen that markets are irrational. So, some bets go wrong, like for the ones listed below. Even then, impossible allotments like that of Jinkushal Industries recently results in negative listing. Which is why I have continued to stick to my strategy with the hope that in the long run, most of these keep growing. You can read more about my strategy on that other post.

While you don't see the discount listing issues here, I have listed them here: CarTrade, Nuvoco Vistas, Aptus, Sansera Engineering, ABSL AMC, PB Fintech, SJS Enterprises, PayTM, AGS Transact, Rainbow Children's Medicare, LIC, Keystone Realtors, Uniparts India, Digvi, Avalon Tech, Maoj Vaibhav, Updater Services, IRM Energy, Muthoot Microfin, Jana SFB, R K Swamy, Gopal Namkeen, Aadhar Housing Finance, Brigade Hotel Ventures, Leela, Ather Energy, Ajax Engineering, Carraro, and Hyundai. The total loss would be shy of about 80k.

Some stats:

* Out of the 631 applications across 3 retail accounts, I have been allotted 125 times. That's about 22% success rate
* If I didn't sell the allotted lots, I would be setting on a profit of 650k
* My best performing IPO is: IREDA (380%)

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Not a fan of ipos but I'm generally not a big fan of IPOs because I don't see them as great long-term investments. However, lately, I've been hearing a lot about the growing popularity and brand recognition of JSW paints and cement from my friends in the construction industry. This has me thinking about whether the JSW Cement IPO might be an exception to my rule.
From what I've read, JSW Cement is positioning itself as a ""green"" cement company, which is an interesting angle given the growing focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing. They're reportedly India's largest producer of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), and their CO2 emissions are significantly lower than their competitors. This, combined with the overall infrastructure boom in India, seems to create a compelling growth story.
However, a closer look at their financials reveals some red flags. The company's revenue has been relatively flat over the last couple of years, and it actually posted a loss in the most recent fiscal year (FY25) after being profitable in the previous years. Their debt-to-equity ratio is also quite high, and their margins are lower than some of the industry leaders. The IPO proceeds are intended to fund new expansion projects and repay debt, which could be a positive, but it also highlights the company's high capital expenditure and leverage.
The IPO was subscribed around 8 times, with strong interest from institutional investors, but the retail portion saw a more moderate response. The GMP (Grey Market Premium) has been fluctuating, suggesting a somewhat cautious but stable listing.
So, for those of you who are more familiar with the cement industry or have experience with IPOs, what's your take on JSW Cement as a long-term investment?",1755111523.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1mpd9qu/not_a_fan_of_ipos_but/

The GMP has moved up from ₹10 to around ₹28–30 per share, implying potential listing gains of 27–30%. While this signals strong demand, it also sharpens questions about whether valuations are running ahead of fundamentals.

**Why This IPO Matters**

* One of the few tech-enabled services IPOs in 2025, testing investor appetite for the gig-economy model.
* Asset-light business spanning home services, product sales, and international markets (UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia).
* Proceeds earmarked for technology upgrades, cloud infrastructure, office expansion, and marketing — geared toward growth rather than balance sheet repair.

**Key Risks**

* Sustainability of FY25 profitability remains to be proven.
* High competition, aggressive customer acquisition spends, reliance on gig workers, and potential regulatory headwinds.
* Heavy OFS component — a large portion of the issue involves existing shareholders exiting, which could influence supply dynamics post-listing.

Urban Company’s IPO is more than just a listing event. It marks a milestone in India’s evolving gig economy. The opportunity is genuine — but so are the execution risks.",1757321111.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nbig3o/urban_company_ipo_beyond_the_grey_market_buzz_a/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"NSDL: What's the plan for long-term? 1. Zero debt.

2. NSDL is a key player in India's financial infrastructure, serving as the country's first and largest depository. It plays a critical role in the digitization of securities, enabling paperless stockholding for investors.

3. While its competitor, CDSL, has a dominant share in retail demat accounts, NSDL holds the lion's share of assets under custody by value, with a strong client base of institutions, high-net-worth individuals, and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). This provides NSDL with a stable and predictable revenue stream, as a significant portion of its income comes from recurring fees.

4. NSDL's business extends beyond its core depository services. It also has a payments bank (NSDL Payments Bank Ltd) and a database management arm (NSDL Database Management Ltd), which offer services like KYC verification and the National Skills Registry. This diversification, while currently a small contributor to profits, offers long-term growth potential in the digital financial services and e-governance space.

5. The growth of India's capital markets, along with increasing retail investor participation and the government's push for digital financial services, provides a strong tailwind for NSDL's business.

Risks:

1. While NSDL's revenue is largely recurring, it is still exposed to market fluctuations. A slowdown in the securities market or reduced trading volumes could impact its transaction-based fees.

2. As a market infrastructure institution, NSDL operates under strict regulations. Any changes in regulations or non-compliance could pose a risk.

3. Following its IPO, NSDL's stock experienced a significant rally. Investors should carefully evaluate the stock's valuation to ensure it aligns with their investment strategy.

I got an allotment in the GNG Electronics IPO, and now I’m at a crossroads — looking for advice from experienced investors here.

The GMP (grey market premium) looks decent, so I expect a decent listing gain. But at the same time, I’m wondering if it might be wiser to hold the stock for 2–3 years, depending on the company’s fundamentals and future growth prospects.

Some key points:

I’m a retail investor, still learning.

My risk appetite is moderate.

I’m not in urgent need of liquidity.

I'm considering the long-term potential if the company shows consistent earnings and market share growth.


I’d love to hear your views:

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"One Up On Wall Street - Part 1 Hi everyone,

I have been posting the summary of **One up on wall street** based on the set of books recommended in this [List](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaGrowthStocks/comments/1htigh6/10_mustread_books_for_investors/?share_id=WmXLPNoBwyvmqrzZzZ8gj&utm_name=ioscss). Starting with the summary of the introduction chapter from the one up on wall street. You can follow the continuation post from these links below.

The points here will be my interpretation of the book rather than what Peter Lynch is trying to teach, so follow it up with your own reading.

TLDR:

**If you have decided to pick stocks on your own then**

1. The **most useless information** about a stock is it's **price**
2. **Stop listening** to the **noise** including the so called professional Investors
3. Observe your surroundings the **best stock**s are always **around you** (liking)
4. Liking a company is not good enough reason to buy the stock, you need to do **your** **own research**(which is what he will be teaching in this book)
5. Even if the company is good never **overpay**
6. Have patience bulls and bears are not **everlasting**

The goal of this book according to **Peter Lynch** is Any Normal person (I am not sure about abnormal people, he didn't mention it in the book. if you are a weirdo then you are on your own i guess) can pick a stock better than a fund manager just by observing your surroundings. you don't have to listen to news, check fancy websites just observe what people are doing, where people are buying and so on.

He promises to teach us the readers(Normal persons) how to do that by pointing us towards few fundamentals like

1. Which numbers really count when we are looking at a stock and what do they mean
2. Guidelines for how to pick cyclical, turnaround and fast growing companies

To set a little bit of context here, This version of the book that all of us will find in bookshelves is the millennium edition that was updated and release in April 2000, right around the time of Dotcom bubble burst. So he talks a little about the Dotcom IPO frenzy without knowing the market is going to crash when the book hits the shelves (We can replace dotcom with AI for current period).

Initial conversation is about how neither bear market nor the bull market last forever and that patience is required in the stock market, people with patience will be rewarded in the end. Then the IPO's of the dotocm companies where the valuation were so high that many millionaires are forming in the valley right after their IPO without having to prove themselves, he cautions people who felt missed out on these IPOs that they are lucky since the prices were so high that only a few would have benefited since everyone else is paying so much with so little earning to show for it(**Never pay High**). One reason why these stocks were risky is that you cannot measure their P/E ratio since they didn't have the important component of the P/E called E, earnings which companies are supposed to have.

Peter tells despite all this drama surrounding him, he still invested only based on ancient fundamentals. It goes like this

* Company enters a market
* It earns money
* Then stock price increases
* Or a flawed company turns itself around

**The stock Price** is the most useless information you can find about a company. What the market pays for a stock this week or next week does not tell whether the company will succeed in 3 or 4 years down the line. If you have to follow any data about the company follow one useful information which is the **earnings** assuming if the company has any.

New Industries form in every time period, but only a handful of companies survive and Only very few become the top ones. you can't just pick a stock because the field is exciting, you need find a good company, even if a company is great you should never overpay.

He provides the example **Electronic Data Systems** whose P/E was 500 at the time which he notes would take five centuries to make your investments. This is nothing but people buying on the basis of Hope than fundamentals, to avoid this he provides three ideas.

I will be modifying the examples for our time rather than the dotcom period

1. Sell shovels and Pick when there is a gold rush
   * Rather than betting on which AI company will make or break just invest in the companies that makes the stuff required for the AI. (Chips, Data center, power supply, fiber optics and so on)
2. Invest in an old company that is starting a new vertical
   * Microsoft will survive on other verticals even if their investment in Chatgpt fails, same way they survived the smart phone fuck up. This give at least protection of capital for you.(Stock market doesn't guarantee anything other than ""you will lose your money for sure"" but possible)
3. Invest in Company that leverages AI to improve their business
   * Any company that uses the new technology to improve efficiency and profit in their existing business models  (Currently everyone is slapping AI on their products)

To find these companies one doesn't have to do any research, Just observing your workplace, home, surroundings, restaurants and so on.

To give an example from our current time, I went to **Zudio** casually one day just to stroll around, only to see a sea of people standing in line to bill at least 5 items each, then I went to upper floor to see huge crowd still shopping and trying out clothes with at least 5 items in hand(almost closing time). I though this is such a good business and they must be making a lot of profits. I came home to check if they are listed in the market to find Trent valued at 4.5K per share. Unfortunately for me I did not start investing years before when it was available at 200 a piece.

Just because you like a product they sell doesn't mean you should buy it, one ought keep a list of stocks they like then do the fundamentals analysis before buying it. The important things to notice are the company's

1. Future earning prospects
2. Competitive position (Moat)
3. Expansion plans

If it's a retail company like **Zudio** you need to figure out if it's nearing the end of expansion phase, which peter terms as late innings. since earnings will not grow multi fold as it did during the early expansion phase.

**Conclusion:** When i started this post, I though I would be summarizing what I read, but I may have over estimated my talent to summarize stuff and ended up writing another book about a book i read. Similar to those annoying videos on YouTube that summarizes movies. Provide me feedback whether this is helpful or not, feel free to ask Chatgpt to summarize my summary.

I’m curious about what to realistically expect at listing. A few questions I had:

Do you think this will sustain the GMP or list even higher?

Is it better to book profits on listing day or hold for a few weeks/months?

Edit:Every response to my post mostly focuses on the P/E ratio. I understand that this P/E is low compared to the entire sector. However, do you think the sector itself isn't overvalued? Right now, in India, sectors like solar, pharma, EV, and AI are considered futuristic, and retail investors are eager to capitalize on these opportunities, which may lead to overall industry overvaluation.

I still believe that stocks could experience a dip—perhaps in a day, a week, or even a few months—and I would consider this stock then.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Warning: Don’t Trust SME IPO GMPs on InvestorGain – My Experience with Marc Loire Wanted to share a cautionary experience for fellow investors following SME IPOs.

I recently applied for the **Marc Loire SME IPO**, which ended up listing at a **24% discount to the issue price** — a rough outcome. Here's where I went wrong:

* On the **IPO closing day**, I saw a **+15% GMP** on **InvestorGain**.
* I didn’t check the **subscription data** or the **GMP trend/history**.
* I assumed: *“SME IPOs rarely allot anyway. If I do get lucky, I’ll just flip it for 10% gain.”*

What I missed was that the GMP had been hovering around **0–6%** before a **sudden spike to 15%** near the end. Then, the day after the IPO closed, the GMP fell **back to zero**. That’s when I started digging deeper.

---

### Pattern I Noticed in Several SME IPOs:

1. **GMP starts low** during the early subscription window.
2. It **ramps up artificially** just before the IPO closes (often 10–20%).
3. Once subscription ends, the GMP **crashes to zero or negative**.
4. The stock **lists at a sharp discount**, sometimes hitting **lower circuits for days**.

This behavior feels like GMP manipulation to attract last-minute retail interest — something that’s easy to overlook unless you're tracking the full GMP timeline.

---

### Takeaways:

* **Don’t trust last-minute GMP surges**, especially on platforms like **InvestorGain**.
* Check the **GMP trend**, not just the final number.
* Pay attention to **subscription data**, especially QIB and NII categories.
* Be cautious with **SME IPOs** — they’re often illiquid, risky, and easily influenced.

Just putting this out there so others can avoid the same trap. Do your due diligence, especially with smaller IPOs.",1751864912.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ltlpjw/warning_dont_trust_sme_ipo_gmps_on_investorgain/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"My Perspective on NSE Pre-IPO Investment: A Long-Term Wealth Opportunity   
The upcoming IPO of NSE, accessible via the unlisted market, presents what I believe to be an exceptional long-term investment opportunity. After thorough research and analysis, I consider NSE to be a ""no-brainer"" due to the following attributes that highlight its immense potential:

---

Key Merits of NSE Stock

1. Monopoly in a Growing Market:
   - NSE is essentially a monopoly in India, a country with over 130 crore people. Its scale dwarfs exchanges across 10 countries combined.
   - With a booming retail investor base, NSE captures the majority of stock market revenues in India. Notably, demat accounts have grown from 4 crore to 8-10 crore in just 2-3 years, with the potential for further exponential growth.

2. Fintech Powerhouse:
   - Established in 1993, NSE is arguably one of the most profitable and mature fintech companies globally. While the fintech space has gained popularity in the last 5-10 years, NSE has been consistently delivering growth for nearly three decades.

3. Diverse and Stable Revenue Streams:
   - NSE benefits from various sources of revenue, including listing fees, transaction charges, clearing services, IT services, treasury income, and depository services. These revenue streams have made it a consistently profitable business for over 30 years.
   - Moreover, NSE controls highly profitable subsidiaries, further diversifying its income sources.

4. Incredible Profit Margins and Cash Reserves:
   - With a net profit margin of around 52%, NSE operates at an extraordinary level of profitability compared to other companies, which typically achieve 15-20% margins.
   - NSE also boasts over ₹12,000 crores in cash reserves, demonstrating its financial strength.

5. Strong Growth in Indian Markets:
   - India has one of the lowest retail participation rates (around 4%) compared to countries like the US (over 60%). Even a modest increase in this percentage would translate into substantial gains for NSE.
   - Given the rising number of retail investors and an expanding middle class, the next decade is expected to be a golden period for equity markets, where NSE will remain the primary beneficiary.

6. Dividend Payouts and Shareholder Returns:
   - NSE has rewarded its shareholders with rising dividends, including a recent payout of ₹90 per share. This consistent dividend policy highlights the company's commitment to returning capital to investors.

7. Historical Parallels to Wealth Creation:
   - If we look at past performance of blue-chip stocks like Infosys, Bajaj Finance, and Asian Paints, the returns over the last three decades have been staggering. NSE, with its monopolistic advantage and profitability, has the potential to deliver similar long-term wealth creation.

8. Limited Competition:
   - Even if a new stock exchange emerges, it would take at least a decade to compete with NSE’s infrastructure, brand, and market dominance. Hence, competition poses minimal risk.

9. Valuation Potential:
   - With an EPS of ₹207 and a conservative PE ratio of 50, NSE's current estimated price is around ₹10,350. However, as a monopoly, its PE could justifiably be 60-70, making the stock's growth potential even more significant.
   - BSE, which holds just 4% market share, commands a PE of 77.5, while MCX trades at a PE of 165. Given NSE's dominant position, it is undervalued relative to these smaller competitors.

10. Growth Projections:
    - NSE’s profit has grown at a stunning 35% CAGR over the past five years. Even if we project a conservative 25% growth rate, EPS could reach ₹600 within five years.
    - Applying a PE of 50 to this future EPS gives a price target of ₹30,000+ per share by 2028, and this does not factor in a potential bull rally, which could drive valuations even higher.

---

 Risk Considerations and Disclosures:

While I am optimistic about NSE’s long-term prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with investing in unlisted shares:

- Liquidity Risk:Unlisted shares are inherently illiquid compared to listed equities. It may be difficult to sell NSE shares quickly before they list on the stock exchange.

- Valuation Risk: Pricing in the unlisted market can be volatile and may not always reflect the company's true value, especially in a pre-IPO scenario.

- Regulatory Risk:NSE, like any financial institution, is subject to regulatory oversight, and changes in regulatory frameworks could impact its business model.

- Market Sentiment: NSE’s performance may be affected by macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical factors. A downturn in the broader market could impact its valuation and performance.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"SEBI has proposed some changes to the structure of large IPOs Here are some of the proposals:

1. As the average IPO sizes have been increasing, direct retail participation has remained flat over the past three years. For large public issues, retail subscription levels have been particularly muted.
2. SEBI proposed that for IPOs exceeding 50 billion rupees ($571 million), the retail investor allocation may be reduced to 25% from the current 35%, while the allocation for institutional buyers may be increased from 50% to 60% in a graded manner.
3. It also proposed increasing the number of permissible anchor investor allottees for allocations above 2.5 billion rupees.
4. It suggested including insurance companies and pension funds in the reserved category of the anchor investor portion, alongside mutual funds.
5. It proposed raising the reservation for life insurers, pension funds, and domestic mutual funds from 30% to 40% of the anchor investor portion, of which one-third would remain reserved for domestic mutual funds, while 7% would be set aside for insurance companies and pension funds.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"help me calculate odds of winning a IPO there r 3 category

1 - retail - 15K

2 - small hni - 2L

3 - big hni - 10L

till now i thought odds of winning is based on oversubscription rate

letz take example of ongoing ipo indo farm

the retail is oversubscribed by 45X

35% shares is reserved for retailers

so i thought odds of winning is 1 in 45 ?

am i right or wrong ?

but in small hni and big hni both oversubscribed by 130X approx

so is odds of winnin 1 in 130 ?

but for big hni 10% frm total shares is reserved

but for small hni only 5%

so will the odds change ?

will big hni become odds 130/2 = 65X ?

see attached pics of data

assume the subscription rates will remain same for closing day tomorow

and calculate odds of winning for each category plz

bcz i see ipo as a lottery

bcz im a poker player

so i calculate odds for everything

but im not maths student

im confuse will i have more odds if i apply in big hni

i applied as small hni 2024 full not win any

shud i arrange funds take OD etc. and apply as big hni ?",1735750836.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hr6zhu/help_me_calculate_odds_of_winning_a_ipo/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Ola Electric: From Market Leader to Meltdown? Ola Electric’s market cap is still hovering around ₹22,000–23,000 crore, but the fundamentals just don’t justify it right now. The stock has tanked nearly 50% in the last six months and is trading at ₹50–51, way below its IPO price of ₹76 and miles off its all-time high of ₹157. The recent 3.2% equity block deal (worth ₹731 crore) only added to the selling pressure, with the stock dropping another 7% in a day.

Here’s why I think it’s time to exit:

* **Widening Losses:** Q4 FY25 net loss ballooned to ₹870 crore (vs ₹416 crore last year), and annual losses for FY25 hit ₹2,276 crore. Revenue collapsed 59% YoY last quarter to just ₹611 crore, and full-year revenue is down too.
* **Falling Sales:** Vehicle registrations dropped over 52% YoY last quarter. Deliveries nearly halved. This isn’t just seasonality—TVS and Bajaj have overtaken Ola in monthly EV sales.
* **No Profit in Sight:** Management is promising profitability in FY26, but brokerages aren’t convinced. Kotak has slashed its target to ₹30 (another 40% downside from here), citing ongoing EBITDA losses, weak brand equity, and tough competition. Even the most optimistic brokerages have targets below the IPO price.
* **Technical Weakness:** The stock is trading below almost all key moving averages (5, 10, 100, 150, 200-day SMAs)—clear bearish signals.
* **Execution Risks:** The company’s big bet on motorcycles and cell manufacturing is still unproven. Battery yields are stuck at 63% and need to cross 80% before they can even use them in their own vehicles.
* **Better Alternatives:** Analysts are openly recommending switching to other EV plays or established auto stocks. The sector is getting crowded, and legacy players are ramping up fast.

**Retail investors** should be extra careful here:

* Ola Electric’s market share has plunged from 49% to under 19% in just six months.
* ICRA recently downgraded its credit rating to BBB+ (Negative) due to ongoing losses and missed government incentive targets.
* The stock has dropped over 50% from its peak value.
* The company is under regulatory scrutiny and has initiated mass layoffs.
* Ola Electric receives over 80,000 customer complaints per month, signaling deeper operational issues.

**Bottom line**: The market cap is still way too high for a company with shrinking sales, ballooning losses, and no clear path to profit. Unless you’re betting on a miracle turnaround, there are safer and better bets in the EV/auto space right now. If it breaks below ₹45, the technicals could get even uglier.

Not financial advice, but I’m out. What do you all think?",1748937448.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1l266mw/ola_electric_from_market_leader_to_meltdown/

**Purpose of IPO** 

Capex ( 8 new stores)        12cr   
Working capital requirement (new stores) 160cr   


&#x200B;

**Business**  


  
 started in 1994, based out of Vizag   
 leading regional jewellery brand in Andhra Pradesh and Telengana.  
First mover in Andhra.   
Their main focus is tapping the high growth untapped regions within the micro-markets of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana.   
**77% of stores are in Tier 2/Tier 3 cities.**  


store network of 13 stores ( 2 franchisees) -Andhra Pradesh, Telangana.

Their flagship showroom V Square spanning 29,946 sqft is one of the largest in Visakhapatnam.  
**Manoj Vaibhav Gems has a market share of 4% of the overall Andhra Pradesh and Telangana jewellery market and 10% of the organized jewellery market of Andhra & Telengana.**  
Main competitors are Titan, Kalyan Jewellers, Malabar Gold, Joyalukkas.  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Industry overview**  


&#x200B;

The Indian jewellery market size Rs 5,74,000cr in FY23. 68% of industry is unorganized, 32% organized, mostly brick & mortar with limited online sale.   


**Rural India forms 58% of gold jewellery demand.**   


**Breakup of gold demand as per use**   


Bridal wear 55%  
Daily wear 35%  
Fashion wear 10%  


**40% of gold demand of India is from South india**  
   
Andhra & Telengana market size is Rs 50000cr expected to grow at 18% CAGR.  


&#x200B;

 

**Operating metrics**  


Number of stores in Andhra-  Manoj Vaibhav 11, Titan 15, Malabar gold 15

**Average revenue / sqft is Rs 54750 (Titan Rs 21950),**despite most of their stores are in Tier 2/Tier 3 towns.  
**Average revenue/ store is Rs 150cr ( Titan Rs 90cr, Kalyan 77cr)**  


89% of revenues from gold, 11% others( Platinum, diamond, silver)  
Comparable regional peer is Thangamail jewellers, **net margins of Manoj Vaibhav Gems better than Thangamail, and similar to Kalyan.** 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **Financials**  


Annual revenues of Manoj Vaibhav Gems is 2030cr.  PAT  70cr.   
**Last 18 year revenue CAGR since 2005 is 22.7%**   


EBITDA margins 7.3% (Thangamail 4.9%, Kalyan 8.1%)  
PAT margins 3.5%  (Thangamail 2.5%, Kalyan 3.4%)  
ROCE at 17.7%   


Borrowing at 460cr   
debt/ equity ratio at 1.41  
Cashflow from operations 70cr  
Inventory is 930cr ( **inventory turns 2.2),for Kalyan 2, Thangamail 3.2**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

**Points to consider**  


10% share of organized jewellery market is significant,considering 4 other prominent players are present in those states including leader Titan. But bigger players Titan and Kalyan are expanding network very fast with access to much higher capital base. Along with that, Joylukkas and Malabar gold also have significant presence in Andhra. So significant competition is there, and jewellery business favours larger organized players as lot of capital is required to expand fast in jewellery owing to huge inventory cost of gold, considering capex is done through franchisee mode.  


**65% of revenues comes from Vizag only, so there is significant dependence on single town.**  


**Revenue/ sqft are more than 2x of even Titan,considering Vizag is not a metro** ( most revenues) which is surprising. Other metrics are comparable to Thangamail and Kalyan.  


&#x200B;

**Valuation**  


**Manoj Vaibhav Jewellers is valued at P/E of 14.5,** whereas comparable peer Thangamail trades at P/E of 27, Titan trades at 90, Kalyan 45",1695453697.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/16pxwzu/manoj_vaibhav_gems_n_jewellers_ipo_analysis/

I applied for the Belrise Industries IPO through 3 different PAN accounts, and I'm happy to share that I got 1 lot each from 2 accounts (so 2 lots in total).

I know the retail portion was subscribed around 4.27x, and the current GMP is hovering around ₹28–₹30, indicating a possible listing around ₹118–₹120 (25–30% premium over the ₹90 issue price).

I’m curious about what to realistically expect at listing. A few questions I had:

Do you think this will sustain the GMP or list even higher?

Is it better to book profits on listing day or hold for a few weeks/months?

Any views on the fundamentals or long-term potential of the company?

This is **not** a copy-paste, but entirely my own research. Source of most of the company data is Red Herring Prospectus available [here](https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/nov-2023/indian-renewable-energy-development-agency-limited-rhp_79087.html) but other relvent info is my personal research and understanding of the industry.

This is shared for educational purposes. Both mine and yours. I had no plans to write this, but when I researched and wrote points for my own investment, it become detailed enough that I thought of putting slightly more effort and making it into an article.

# Business model

&#x200B;

* IREDA is a central govt company made in 1987 to specifically give loans to renewable energy projects in India.
* Currently, it is the largest renewable energy financing company in India and have given out loans nearing 50000crores.
* IREDA's business is quite simple to understand yet many do not understand. They basically takes loans at 6.23% interest and then use that money to give loans to big renewable energy projects at average interest of around 10%, thus profiting 4% of everything they borrow!
* It is beneficial for companies that take these loans too as 10% is still a much lower interest rate than many other business loans from other sources. Thus win-win.
* People see the large debt and is wary of investing in a company with debt, that maybe true for normal companies but not for finance companies. Here they are all very good debt and this is exactly how all financial companies make money. More debt means more money to lend, and make more money.
* Their borrowing rate is the lowest among their peers. They borrow about half from domestic sources like RBI and bonds and the other half from foreign green investors including Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Asian Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement and the World Bank.
* The average cost of borrowing of IREDA is 6.23% in 2023. Other financing companies like REC limited have 6.96% and Power Finance Corporation Limited have 7.1% interest for the loans they borrow. Being able to borrow for such low rates, even less than Fixed-Deposits is the biggest advantage for a finance company.

&#x200B;

[The largest solar farm in the world is in Bhadla, Rajasthan. Funded partially by IREDA.](https://preview.redd.it/rpa6taypzv2c1.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c4930fab9dde7431ec802b622872eaa8233db18)

&#x200B;

# Why Low risk

# 

* Their main customers are large solar power plants and wind mills. More than 46% of their customers have made a legal agreement with the government(PPA) for the price at which govt will buy electricity from them. This is a permanent agreement that cannot be altered. This agreement was done to encourage renewable energy investments in India.
* So, a company that started in 2014 may have an agreement to sell electricity at a higher rate than a company that started in 2019 because cost of investment was higher in 2014.
* This basically guarantees profits no matter which year a renewable energy company was started as this fixed price means these solar/wind companies are guaranteed to get revenue from govt and thus guaranteed to pay their loans. There have been couple of instances of state govts wanting to get out of this agreement like in Andra Pradesh, but the govt eventually lost the case in court.
* The Andhra Pradesh high court gave order in 2022 that power contracts cannot be renegotiated and asked the state to clear dues estimated at Rs 30,000 crore to renewable energy generators in six weeks.
* But apart from that 93.4% of the loans are secured with collateral, so if the company is unable to pay in the worst case, IREDA can liquidate their collateral to recover money.
* 99.6% of the loan taking customers have taken compulsory insurance against natural disasters like Earthquake, flood, cyclone etc. So, there is no risk from disasters.
* 94.3% of the loans are given on floating interest rate, meaning the interest-payment is linked to inflation, thus there is no inflation risk to IREDA.
* 20 biggest customers account for 40% of the total loans given.
* IREDA has given loans in 23 states, so the political risk is spread across India.
* Only 1.66% of the loans given have turned out to be Non performing assets(NPAs). The net NPAs exhibited improvement, decreasing from 3.12% to 1.66% in FY23
* Out of this 1.6%, more than 70% were the loans given to Biomass plants and hydro plants, both of which were a learning experience for the company. The solar and wind are the main areas of expected growth in next 6 years, so I think NPA percentage will further come down.

&#x200B;

# Why high value

# 

* Generally, Govt PSUs are huge companies in the 50k+ range market cap. But this one is a 8k market cap company. It is basically a government startup that is in a highly lucrative field that is about to blow up.
* Government companies are generally inefficient at doing complicated projects. Like HAL has to make fighterjets. Mazagon have to make ships.  All of them are too complicated, and easy for govt company to messup. But here it is a simple business model with low number of employees required.
* They just have 175 employees, but with an average experience of 18years! Basically like a startup, but focused on one thing only.
* Government companies that has too many customers are also generally inefficient like Air India, Railways or BSNL. But, here they have one of the lowest number of customers. Thus it is easy for a govt company to manage and give good service.
* Govt is currently looking to monetize its companies and earn dividends every year. So, new guidelines says all central public sector enterprise are required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth. IREDA is a profit making company for a long time. Thus, it will give good dividend in future too.
* Govt companies generally lists showing their actual value, and is not incentivized to list at blown up valuations. Here the net worth of the company is 6,580 crore. And the market cap is 8600 crore at Rs32 per share. Considering stock market is forward looking, there is huge scope for growth.
* India has committed to make 500GW of renewable energy by 2030. That is MASSIVE. India's total energy consumption from all sources currently is for example 190GW.
* India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 70.10 GW as of July 2023
* IREDA was the financier of 22GW of renewable energy in India as of now including partially financing the largest solar power plant in the world.
* Prime minister Modi had infused 1500 crore just last year into IREDA to fast up the growth of renewable energy. This shows clear govt support for this company. But anyway my point is that 1500 crore out of 6500 crore networth of the company is direct funds from last year given for free by govt.
* Even after this IPO, 75% of the stock will still be owned by the central government, thus they are committed in the growth of this company.
* IREDA also fully owns a 50MW solar power plant in Kerala that generates 28crore per year revenue.

&#x200B;

# The current timing is awesome

&#x200B;

* 58000 crore worth of money was used to apply for IREDA IPO of just 2150 crore. Last week saw the biggest IPOs of this year. 5 IPOs that came in the week totaling 2.6lakh crore, total of 2.6lakh crore were invested. This is largest amount ever invested in a week in Indian history.
* Among these 5 stocks, IREDA will be the first to get listed, and there is  gap for others to be listed.
* More than 2.5lakh crore of this locked-up capital will be unfrozen just before IREDA is listed.
* This can cause it to show unprecedented demand when all of these people who have not got any IPO will look at buying the first IPO that got listed.
* But it will take people some time to realize this value, and stocks are forward looking, so I think in around 1-2years people will realize the potential and the price will skyrocket.
* Two years ago a similar PSU company IRFC which lends money to Railways went for IPO. It was priced at 26 rupees. But got listed at a loss of 3.5%. Its share price increase to 90 when people realized its value.
* IRFC was only subscribed 3x by QIBs. This time IREDA is 104x subscription from QIBs. There is clear interests from banks, mutual funds and govt institutions for investing in IREDA with long term view.
* IRFC lends only to railways. The scope of IREDA is substantially bigger, and is at the right time when renewable has finally become viable.
* Currently there is a trend of PSUs generally skyrocketing few years after IPO. Look at what happened to Irfc, Rvnl, IRCTC and Mazgaon.

&#x200B;

# Growth

IREDA has enough space to grow in the next 6 years. And even at 5x the IPO price, it will be a company under 50k crore market capitalization. Since stock market is forward looking, it is possible that big funds will also go long on this much before than the actual value of the company reaches there.  And the size of the company is small enough for it to get influenced by the big funds.

&#x200B;

Stock price at various Market capitalization visualization.

₹32 - 8.6k crore

₹64 - 17.2k crore

₹96 - 25.8k crore

₹128 - 34.4crore

₹160 - 43k crore

&#x200B;

This is a highly scalable data-driven business with very low risk of lending. Like, you know exactly what a solar panel will cost, and how much money it will produce over the years, so you are unlikely to give bad loans. In other financing companies, the risk is high like if you give loans to an airline or for making an ebike manufacturing factory, or give out personal loans, data is not the same for each loan-taker even in same industry. So, it is possible one ebike company makes profit while other do not. But that is not the case with solar or wind energy.

In one way I am happy I am getting to buy this stock at undervalued prices, but I am also mad at the government for selling 25% stake in such a profit making good company for loot prices. They could have got full subscription even at double the price. So, why sell low?

In general, this looks like a very good stock for long term value investing. There are so many upsides but very little downsides. I am going for long in this one.

I have purchased IREDA stock in IPO in HNI quota. And intent to purchase more at market pre-open if the price is below 45. So my views maybe biased.

Annual revenues 270cr. PAT 30cr.  
Revenue from operations grew at 36% CAGR, EBITDA grew at 55% CAGR, PAT at 124% from F21 to F23.

**Profits have become 5X in last 2 years.**

ROCE at healthy 31%, increased .  
**Capacity utilization is 83%** which is good.  
There are no listed peers in India with whom its performance can be compared

  
 

**Points to consider**  


Though  Stainless steel pipes are very much advantageous over rubber /polymer  hose, the latter is relatively cheaper which makes cost-conscious  customers tilting towards it.  
Industry has high entry barrier in terms of requirement of R&D capabilities.  
Raw materials are stainless steel ( sourced mainly from outside) which are **subject to  steel price fluctuations.**  
**They  purchase raw material under short term contracts, sourced mainly from  China. For end products too, they don't have any long term contracts  with any customers.**  
80% of revenues are dependent on exports , though diversified , except for only US (28%).  
**Dependence on single manufacturing unit** is a kind of risk.

  
Business requires high inventory , contributing 30-40% of revenues. 84cr coming from IPO will suffice for near term.  


Company is already operating at **high  capacity utilization of 83-90% , but not yet disclosed any expansion  plans which they will require for growing revenues at high pace. They  will need to raise debt for that.**  


**Valuation**  


Aeroflex industries is valued at P/E of 45 ( possibly being a high growth company)  according to the price band given.

1. At IPO price, market cap will be at Rs. 58k Cr. IPO is valued at P/Bx of 3.2x
2. Other large size peers like LIC Housing, PNB Housing, Canfin Housing are available at P/B 1.3-2.7x.
3. Smaller players like Aadhar, Aavas, Aptus and Home Finance are available at range of 3.3x to 4.8x.
4. Last 3 years growth - AUM growth of 31% CAGR over FY22-24 with 56% PAT CAGR
5. BHFL has lowest GNPA & NNPA in the industry (best asset quality)

So, considering all parameters - its presence in housing finance & other financing space, its superior growth, and best operational metrics along with Top class proven Promoters - BHFL will attract Premium Valuations.

Listing Price View - As per current GMP  it is likely to List around 100% Gains i.e., Rs. 140-150 range vs issue price of Rs. 70/-.

With such listing, it will be available at P/B of above 6x. Leaves limited upside growth.

Sell on Listing - Price above Rs. 130-140

Hold on Listing - Incase of bad listing with 30-60%.

Fresh Buying - Only below Rs. 100-110 range or else I will wait for market to settle down & wait for price discovery because after a good listing gains, hardly any immediate upside is left.

Even though it's a good company, no point in FOMO. Rather I will now focus on other Housing finance company to see if any re-rating possible in other players.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Aether Industries IPO - Analysis and Review Aether Industries Ltd. (AIL) is a speciality chemical manufacturer in India focused on producing advanced intermediates and speciality chemicals involving complex and differentiated chemistry and technology core competencies. Its business was started in 2013 with a vision to create a niche in the global chemical industry with a creative approach to chemistry, technology and systems that would lead to sustainable growth. In the first phase of development through Fiscal 2017, AIL focused on building team and infrastructure and on R&D centre around building core competencies. 

AIL is one of the fastest-growing speciality chemical companies in India, growing at a CAGR of nearly 49.5% between Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2021. (Source: F&S Report, May 2022). It is focusing on the core competencies model of chemistry and technology. According to Frost & Sullivan, chemical companies usually have a single or a couple of chemistry competencies for their entire product portfolio; however, AIL has eight chemistry competencies to use for a wide array of products, which enables it to cater to niche and advanced intermediate requirements of a wider range of end-products and applications. (Source: F&S Report, May 2022). 

All these competencies have been developed in-house, which is one of the core strengths of the R&D team. (Source: F&S Report, May 2022). AIL has three business models under which it operates: (i) large scale manufacturing of its own intermediates and speciality chemicals; (ii) contract research and manufacturing services (""CRAMS"") and (iii) contract/exclusive manufacturing. In the view of Frost & Sullivan, AIL is among the few Indian speciality chemical companies to have successfully launched these three separate business models in just 5 years into commercial manufacturing. (Source: F&S Report, May 2022). 

The company has some nuanced criteria for choosing products based on its chemical complexity, niche applications, limited competition, scalability and commercial potential. Using these criteria, it developed and continues to develop, advanced intermediates and speciality chemicals products having applications in the pharmaceutical, agrochemicals, material science, coatings, high-performance photography, additives and oil & gas segments of the chemicals industry. As of March 31, 2022, AIL's product portfolio comprises over 25 products. AIL's products are advanced intermediates and speciality chemicals that occupy a position in the chemical industry value chain between commodity chemicals and final actives and formulations with its products more closely aligned to the higher value range, further away from the commodities and closer to the final active part of the value chain. 

Most of its advanced intermediates and speciality chemicals product portfolio was developed for the first time in India and constitute 100% import substitution, thus furthering the ""Make in India"" or ""Atma -Nirbharta"" campaigns of the Government of India. AIL also manufactures customers' products under contractual/exclusive supply agreements (its third business model).

AIL's customers include more than 160 multinationals, and global, regional and local companies. As of March 31, 2022, it sold products to 34 global customers in 18 countries and to 154 domestic customers. Its customers include a rich collection of leading domestic and international multinational companies. AIL places importance on developing human resources. As of March 31, 2022, it had 719 employees (excluding trainees) and 150 contract workers and trainees.

#### Weaknesses of Aether Industries

**Some of the weaknesses that the company has are:**

* **Their business is highly dependent on their manufacturing facilities. Slowdowns, shutdowns, strikes, work stoppages, and increased wage demands interfere with their operations. Hence, they affect their business, financial condition and results of operations.**
* **The company’s operations involve the manufacture, usage and storage of various hazardous substances. Therefore, it is exposed to certain risks.**
* **It does not have long-term contracts with its major customers. Therefore, if one or more customers choose not to source their requirements from Aether Industries, then their business will be adversely affected. In addition, termination of existing long-term contracts might have a similar effect.**
* **Their insurance coverage may not adequately protect them against all losses. It may not be available for all the losses as per the insurance policy. Therefore, it might affect their business, financial condition and results of operations.**
* **Non-compliance with and changes in, safety, health, environmental and labour laws and other applicable regulations, may adversely affect their business.**
* **Grants of stock options under their employee stock option plans may result in a charge to their statement of profit loss.**
* **Their contingent liabilities could materially and adversely affect their business, results of operations and financial condition.**
* **The company may use a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment or pre-payment of loans taken from HDFC Bank Limited, which is one of the Book Running Lead Managers.**
* **Any downgrade of their debt ratings could adversely affect their business.**
* **The company’s reliance on certain industries for a significant portion of its sales could have an adverse effect on its business.**
* **Sales from exports and a portion of their expenditures are denominated in foreign currencies. Therefore, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the results of operations.**
* **They are highly dependent on R&D activities for success. Therefore, if they do not develop new products or expand their product portfolio on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner, their business might suffer.**

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**  
  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  


**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.

**Points to consider**  
  
  
Top 5 states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telengana, Gujarat, Delhi constitute 85% of AUM, any adverse calamity in these states would negatively affect the company.  
  
Large exposure in residential and commercial real estate hence any downturn in this sector might affect Bajaj housing finance negatively.  
  
As it is non-deposit taking NBFCs, it relies on borrowings and hence any impact on interest rate might affect them negatively. 44% of borrowings are at fixed interest rates, 56% of borrowings at floating interest rates whereas 99.8% of loans advanced are in floating interest rates.  
  
Their key business strengths lie in strong parentage , diversified funding sources , vast network and risk management (one of the best HFC’s in capital & profitability ratios).  
  
Bajaj finance holds 100% of BHFL, wherein just 1 year before RHP filing they invested approx Rs 2,000 cr as an equity by acquiring 110,74,19,709 shares at Rs 18.1  
  
Average ticket size being 46 lakhs, BHFL caters to premium housing customers, which is growing at 13-15% CAGR. Also it is easy to lend being high ticket vs Affordable housing finance cos with 10 lakh ticket size.  
  
BHFL has grown at stellar speed, just in 8 years AUM of 97000cr, last 2 year AUM CAGR of 31% and PAT CAGR of 56%- all because of huge customer database of Bajaj Finance. It is said data is the most important moat for Bajaj Finance.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Kalyan jewellers - a overhated but interesting stock Before I continue I will interate I have this stock from 100 levels, I know most of you will downvote it mostly and it's fine but I had to make sure that retailers are not getting screwed over by rumours and fake news 

Over the past month kalyan has gone down 35% from its peak , many are calling it names pump and dump and what not, even abusing motilal oswal who got the stock at 350 (an entry which according to me will never come again) 

The allegations on the management are quite frankly absurd and nonsense, none of it has any proof nor has any sebi investigation been triggered 


Now you may say ""you are biased cause you hold it"" yes I am , but I also did my own DD on the stock before I entered it even at 100 levels. When Kalyan jewellers did it's ipo back in 2021 they made 125 crores from ofs , yes 125 crores . They made no money from this stock, they instead purchased more on leverage at 530, now go try doing this for the latest stocks most of the ipo is pure ofs, offloading their garbage on retail and retail eating it, find me such a quality management which puts their money where their mouth is, I will wait


Now onto the allegations -

1) kalyan jewellers paid mutual funds to buy their shares in the fund, why would a company pay fund managers to buy their company when it's growing at twice the pace of the rest of the industry small or big in size? That too in a 80k crores company, sebi isn't so dumb man please let's get that out of the way

2) IT raid , ED raid, if such raids happen to a business family of their level u will see it on news, they were the 30th richest in india just 2 weeks ago and they have many more unlisted business which makes them a very prominent family of south india, u will see it in news but guess what? U didn't cause it is false

3) if the fund manager bribery was not fluff this one certainly tops the list , apparently they bribed ED to avoid arrest , I have heard better stories from drunk beggars

4) inventory overvaluation, for such a company where their inventory is almost the size of titan there is a huge huge audit process with multiple checks and balances , independent as well, u can't just overvalued ur inventory at that scale, it's a national scandal and it will cause chaos 😂 let's be realistic, kalyan jewellers is one of the top 5 gold importers into the country last year, that's the level at which they deal, inventory overvaluation is absurd at so many levels in this case

5) promotors got FIR, if any such cases are running again it will be all over the news ,it needs to be declared to stock exchange 


The overall fall seems to be the product of both the stock being a tad bit overvalued from the top (around 15-20%) along with unfounded rumour mongering, the only ones that made money here are the bears who had a short position in this stock from the very beginning, there was unusual oi in the short side of this stock from December itself , I track it so I noticed it, they refused to sell their shorts even when the stock hit ath, at the time didn't make sense to me , I mean 40% growth update and yet who has the balls to short like that, now it all adds up, they always planned to wait for the promotors trading window to close before they attacked the stock and they chose then business update day to buy cheap shorts as well from open market 


About corporate governance of kalyan have no doubt it's first class
The chairman of the board is the former CAG of india vinod rai, he was the one who exposed the 2G scam of the ruling government without being scared of the PMO , he won't be involved or allowing such things to happen under him, it's all a lot of rumours to get cheap stocks by the institutes according to me

It's a well elaborated short attack according to me , because 2 weeks are over sebi has neither sent any notice to the company nor has there been any news of tax evasion or promotor arrest



This also reminds me of a similar attack same time last year and motilal was a top holder in this stock as well, stock market participants may have short term memory but the charts don't forget, polycab
Polycab had a lot of allegations (which was true considering there was real news as well) stock fell 30% and then went on to give 75% returns in a yearly basis 
I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum in a company based on a bribe and I do not believe motilal will invest 10% aum without proper check on CG
Now the rest readers can take it as it may
I haven't sold a single share in this fall, I don't intend to, I see the stock hitting 1500 in 2 years considering it's forward pe for next year is just 40. Even taking normal or expansion what I said is very fair value for it

I remain long and bullish on the stock, those who say ""don't compare it to titan"" just check the data , data doesn't lie , titan is slipping , they have 8% market share of organised play and kalyan has 7, they had just 4 , just 2 years ago, one is claiming they will hit 10 from the past 3 years one will hit it in a year without needing to make tall claims
Data doesn't lie nor does factual information,
 Good luck investing and take care",1737178172.0,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i40mpb/kalyan_jewellers_a_overhated_but_interesting_stock/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Additional Resources for Fundamental Analysis! **Precursor:** *In this post, I’ll mention some lesser-known resources that I find really useful and that can help you further in your fundamental research. Let’s jump straight into it.*

**1. Tijori Finance:**

I primarily use **Screener**, but **Tijori Finance** provides data that isn’t as easily accessible on Screener.in.

**For example:**

https://preview.redd.it/nmfloulooynd1.jpg?width=1765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77aca7b827d9d8ed80e23d889a5d68b38d501be9

Take **Polycab**—Tijori Finance shows the **product mix**, **export percentages** to different regions, and sometimes even the **distribution channels**. The product mix is especially helpful if you want to quickly discover what contributes the most revenue for the company and then dive deeper from there.

https://preview.redd.it/zdrevr2roynd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=d552db45f81b6fa5ea0a83e89ffb73e4a294de61

In some cases, Tijori even shows the market share of a company. While I’d recommend double-checking the data with other sources, it helps give you a rough idea of where the company stands.

[Screener.in](http://Screener.in) only shows segmental revenue to paid users. For product mix, you can check the company’s latest presentation or annual report, but Tijori Finance offers a quicker option.

https://preview.redd.it/2dplwt1xoynd1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4cc76868d3de62254f141c58894e4760a01f32

Another feature I appreciate in Tijori is the list of links to various articles and videos relevant to the company, right at the bottom of the page.

**2. DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus):**

If you’re not familiar, a **DRHP** is an offer document issued by a company and submitted to SEBI before it goes public. Even though I don’t invest in IPOs, I enjoy reading DRHPs of companies going public because they offer valuable insights into specific industries..

For instance, in the DRHP of **Hyundai**, if you navigate to the ***Industry Overview*** section from the table of contents,

https://preview.redd.it/eb1x6yiyoynd1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce7821e8375278864ebce06b60ae208804fc390

You can get great insights of the **automobile industry**, including market shares and growth trends, to understand the industry's dynamics. You can find the latest [DRHPs here.](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=3&ssid=15&smid=11)

Another helpful resource for sector research is **Motilal Oswal’s sectoral research reports**

https://preview.redd.it/z548l2ozoynd1.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ddb9ea4605652fd3ef3ffbe263620a3690b8ff

Motilal Oswal's website, Research 360, provides up-to-date [sector reports](https://www.research360.in/research-report/sector-report) on industries like financials, hotels, and insurance, offering the latest updates.

[Ibef.org](http://Ibef.org) is another website by ministry of commerce which offers great sectoral insights.

**3. Credit Ratings:**

**Credit ratings** are an underrated resource that can significantly enhance your fundamental research. These reports often contain information that’s hard to find elsewhere.

For example, when I was researching **Eimco Elecon**, a capital goods company that makes underground mining equipment, the credit report gave me a critical insight.

[Eimco Elecon Credit Report](https://preview.redd.it/c8jva6qgpynd1.jpg?width=1038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f9bc6e95df8c93426be2a8496edbc049ed1bd53)

It revealed that the company enjoys a **near-monopoly** in the underground mining equipment segment, with **Coal India as its biggest customer**. That was something I hadn’t come across in other sources and was a key piece of information.

[Lotus Chocolate Company Credit Report](https://preview.redd.it/hdi2samjpynd1.jpg?width=967&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba943cee3c75e494484e52abfffa3d37f19a7ac)

At first glance, the **outrageous valuation** and frequent **upper circuits** were clear red flags. Nonetheless, I wanted to know what the company does. The credit report for **Lotus Chocolate** showed that it had notable **B2B clients** like **Amul** and **Mother Dairy**.

Overall, credit reports are a great resource for gaining deeper insights, especially for lesser-known companies

**4. ValuePickr:**

Many seasoned investors may already know about this one, but for those who don’t, **ValuePickr** is a forum of passionate investors who discuss various companies in dedicated threads.

[ValuePickr Forum](https://preview.redd.it/lx2gmj3spynd1.png?width=1527&format=png&auto=webp&s=569c65884661074c413d94b4133e6cd85e8f8371)

The site has an incredible wealth of information on different companies. Some of the threads go back 5 or even 10 years, and you can find **old annual reports, presentations, and discussions dating back** many years.

[Polycab's thread](https://preview.redd.it/8u93e66upynd1.jpg?width=1392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b47c157fc83b3b10c5048dfbe4ace0470c5ad35)

It’s an excellent tool if you want to track **the management’s execution** or learn more about a company. You might even discover companies that aren’t in the limelight yet.

I follow threads of the companies I'm invested in and **regularly** check for updates. It's one of my favorite resources for research, with knowledgeable investors sharing news and insights..

**To Conclude:** I can’t emphasize enough how crucial it is to review a company’s annual report, presentations, and transcripts as primary sources for fundamental research. That said, I wanted to highlight some additional resources that can offer further insights..

Hope this helps with your fundamental analysis! If you have any other tools to recommend, please share them in the comments below.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Waaree Energies IPO - Pros and Cons 105% GMP! 

Worth it right?

Let's also see the entire positives and negatives.

Positives:

1. Exponentially growing profits that grew more than 30 times in the last 4 years.

2. Reputed company with experienced management having more than 2 decades experience in the sector.

3. The company is at a fair valuation and about to list a PE of 33 compared to the Premier Energies which is trading at a PE of 123.

4. Solar energy sector is a rising sector with huge potential in the upcoming years and Waaree is already positioned as a leading player in the sector.

5. The company has made it clear that the proceeds from the IPO is about to be used mostly for a manufacturing facility with a capacity of 6GW

Negatives/risks:

1. India is dependent on China for solar cells and no manufacturing capacity for most of the raw materials and disruption in raw material supply or increase in pricing by Chinese companies can cause issues for the solar industry.

2. Domestic solar energy sector is dependent on government PLI schemes to run their businesses and any negative change (although highly unlikely) in the policies can impact the sector adversely.

3. Another company in the adjacent clean energy sector, MTAR Technologies, was highly dependant on Bloom Energy for it's business. When Bloom Energy's business dropped, MTAR's revenues also started falling. Although Waaree is not as concentrated in it's clients (48% of revenue is concentrated by top 5 customers), the risk needs to be reduced by diversifying significantly to other customers.

All the above mentioned risks are industry-specific risks and how it impacts the company is highly dependent on how the company handles these challenges. 

Waaree Energies is carrying out it's backward integration plan to to strengthen its supply chain, minimize costs and reduce dependence on China.",1729428293.0,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g7xuxn/waaree_energies_ipo_pros_and_cons/
Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Interesting charts which suggest this party is close to an end TLDR: Current Bull run party is over. Small and mid caps will be first to take a hit.

1. Simply put a Bull Run is a period of overall asset appreciation in general - Nifty 3.3x from Covid Crash bottom and 2x from top of just before covid crash. It has been only 4 years.
2. This attracts more and more people to the market.
   1. Mutual fund industry had AUM of Rs. 65 trillion in July 2024.
   2. History - 30 trillion in 2020, 20 trillion in 2017, 10 trillion in 2014.
   3. This simply indicates more and more money is being poured into the market.
   4. So much so that for the first time DIIs have become equal/crossed FIIs in value in 2024.
3. As people put away their cautiousness and become greedy they get a sense of confidence and take bets in smaller and riskier companies. This is evident as we see smallcaps rise faster than mid and large caps.
   1. Small cap index is 6x since covid bottom whereas nifty is only 3.3x.
   2. Recent popularity of SME IPOs.
4. Finally the charts. These are created by dividing Smallcap and Midcap Indexes by Nifty Index (Below are cnxsmallcap/nifty50 and cnxmidcap/nifty50 respectively)

[cnxsmallcap\/nifty50](https://preview.redd.it/vdk89sp6vmnd1.png?width=3190&format=png&auto=webp&s=101e8ecd63668d69698176dcfb66d8edeb4f9662)

You can see last peak was in 2018 and we all know that from 2018 to 2020 there was a bear run in small caps (and mid too to some extent) - I will not attach these charts. Easy to look them up.

In last 20 years these channels have never been violated, but their boundaries have been clearly respected 5-6 times at least.

So I am of the opinion that this party is over especially in small and midcaps. It may be tomorrow or 6 months from now. Since these are month level charts so can take time. But one monthly reversal candle and it will all tumble. Even if nifty rises for next few years, small and mid caps cannot outperform nifty according to these charts.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"KRN Heat Exchanger (Plausible explanation for the 80% stock rise) Disclaimer: I do have a vested interest in posting this, I have invested quite a bit of my portfolio in KRN, I did this when my manpower staffing company had a discussion with their MD and CHRO but do hear me out.


1. What does KRN do?
KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Limited (KRN) specializes in manufacturing fin and tube type heat exchangers for the heat ventilation air 
conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) industry and their products are primarily made from non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminum. KRN 
customizes heat exchangers in various shapes and sizes to meet customer requirements and market demand with diameters ranging from 5 mm to 15.8 mm. 

2. Recent rise in stock price (manipulation or future expectations of strong profit growth):
KRN has given 80% returns since 1 month and has risen from 447 levels since Nov 5th and touched 800 levels yesterday.


3. A few possible reasons for this:

a. KRN is the only listed heat exchanger manufacturer and that gives investors a chance to get exposure to the HVAC & R components market

b. Q2 performance: The net profit for KRN Heat Exchanger grew 43% year on year at consolidated levels to ₹12.37 crore compared to ₹8.65 crore in the same quarter last year.

c. In their RHP for IPO they mentioned that the proceeds would fund their new manufacturing plant.
(Personal note if you choose to believe me: I work for a manpower staffing agency and we are in discussions with KRN's MD and CHRO for our support for their new plant with approx 2000+ temp and 500 perm workers.)

d. The above point suggests a strong order book that's evidenced by their client base who are mainly in the Air conditioners manufacturing industry including, including Daikin Air conditioning, Schnieder Electric IT Business India, Kirloskar Chillers, Blue Star, Climaventa Climate Technologies and Frigel Intelligent Cooling Systems India

e. In regards to the point above, temperatures around India have been rising due to various reasons with 2024 summer having recorded some serious health concerns around the country. We might be in for the same in 2025 and for the foreseeable future. 
In this case, KRN stands to benefit as demand for coolers will only grow and so will the orders from KRN's clients who are leading AC manufacturers.

f. Their products are also used as components in coolers across various industries like data centres, railways, automotive, defence, medical equipment, washing machines, and a few others. (Chemical manufacturing and oil & gas industries are the two largest consumers of heat exchangers in India, with each accounting for nearly one-fifth of total industry turnover in 2023. Other key end-use consumers are power & energy, HVAC, and metallurgy. Together, these five industries 
contributed to 80% of the heat exchanger industry revenue in 2023.)

g. They have increased their share of business from exports 10% to 15% increasing their customer range in Europe but still maintaining their current domestic order book.


4. Possible risks:

a. 75% of revenue is derived from top 10 customers which can pose a risk if some of them decide to change their component vendors

b. 80% of their raw materials are imported and any increase in tarrifs may affect financial performance 


5. Conclusion: Due to reasons mentioned above and the growth of the HVAC components industry, KRN is a strong long term investment and this might explain its meteoric stock price rise.

Disclaimer: I do have a vested interest in posting this, I have invested quite a bit of my portfolio in KRN, I did this when my company had a discussion with their MD and CHRO

That said, let me know your thoughts on KRN or if you have any questions. Will try to answer them.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Tell me your best earning stocks in last one year and what was thought process while buying it? My Stock Market Experience

When I buy stocks, I first look at key metrics like market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and recent news, especially about new orders or developments related to the stock. After this analysis, I rely on my instincts to make a final decision. While I often make profits, there are times when I incur losses. However, over the last six months, my losses have outweighed my gains.

One stock where I had an interesting experience was Waaree Energies.

My Journey with Waaree Energies

I initially invested in this stock during its IPO. After receiving some shares in the IPO allotment, I bought additional shares on the listing day. I sold all my holdings at ₹2,500 a few days later. However, the stock rallied further to ₹3,800, leaving me regretting my early exit.

Later, when Donald Trump was elected as the U.S. President, the stock saw a downturn due to his policies. Trump frequently expressed his intent to impose duties on imports from China and India, impacting the renewable energy sector. I began buying the stock at ₹3,000, averaging down to ₹2,600, which brought my overall purchase price to ₹2,800. Eventually, I sold my holdings at ₹3,340, making a substantial profit.

Why I Chose Waaree Energies

I was exploring renewable energy stocks because of the increasing adoption of solar panels in households. The Indian government provides a ₹78,000 subsidy under the PM Suryaghar Yojana for installing household solar systems, which has boosted demand.

Despite some concerns over the stock’s valuation, I believed in Waaree because it has the largest solar module manufacturing capacity in India. My bet paid off.

An Important Learning

While I profited, I discovered that Waaree primarily generates revenue through exports rather than domestic household solar installations. This is because the government subsidy of ₹78,000 applies only to solar systems that comply with Domestic Content Requirements (DCR). When I explored installing a solar system for my household, I was surprised that the installer did not have Waaree panels. Despite being a market leader, Waaree did not have DCR-compliant panels in the widely preferred N-type TOPCon bifacial technology.

Currently, Waaree has introduced DCR-compliant panels but still lags in some advanced technologies. I believe the company will eventually produce the best panels in the industry. If the government relaxes DCR compliance rules, Waaree’s stock price could skyrocket.

My Current Outlook

The recent sell-off in Waaree’s stock has created another potential buying opportunity. I’m considering reinvesting in the company as I foresee strong growth in the renewable energy sector.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"$TDIC squeeze potential after $BYND # 🚀 **$TDIC Investment Thesis: Low Float, 70%+ Insider Owned, Short Squeeze Setup?** 🚀

**Dreamland Limited ($TDIC)** - Hong Kong event management company that IPO'd July 23, 2025. Traded **above $7** recently but got **hammered by shorts** to **~$0.61**. Low float + locked insider shares = **potential squeeze play**. Here's why I'm bullish:

---

## 📊 **Key Stats**
| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Insider Ownership** | **70.79-71.73%** (CEO Wai Yue Seto owns ~71.7%) |
| **Public Float** | **~8.76M shares** (out of 31M total) |
| **Short Interest** | **0.24-0.27%** (21.3K shares) |
| **Lock-up Expires** | **~Jan 19, 2026** (180 days from IPO) |
| **Recent High/Low** | **$6.75 → $0.61** |

---

## 💎 **Why Buy $TDIC Now?**

### 1️⃣ **INSIDER SKIN IN THE GAME**
- **70%+ owned by insiders** - they ain't selling anytime soon
- **Lock-up until Jan 2026** = no immediate dump risk from big holders
- Management aligned with shareholders

### 2️⃣ **LOW FLOAT = HIGH VOLATILITY**
- **8.76M float** = tiny supply for explosive moves
- Even modest buying volume can spike this hard
- **Short squeeze potential** if shorts pile in (currently low but could change)

### 3️⃣ **OVERSOLD AFTER SHORT ATTACK**
- Dropped from **$7+ to $0.61** on post-IPO selling + short pressure
- **Events industry recovering** - Hong Kong tourism booming
- Trading at **depressed levels** vs IPO valuation

### 4️⃣ **SQUEEZE CATALYSTS**
- **Low short interest** + **low float** = perfect setup
- **Upcoming earnings** could flip sentiment
- Social media buzz could ignite retail interest

---

## 🔥 **THE PLAY**
- **Entry**: ~$0.61 (current levels)
- **Target**: $3-5 short-term, $7+ if squeeze hits
- **Stop**: $0.40 (tight risk management)

**Float too small, insiders too locked, shorts too cocky.** This smells like a **classic squeeze setup**.

---

## ⚠️ **RISKS**
- **High volatility** - can drop further
- **Illiquid** - wide spreads, hard to exit
- **Events sector sensitive** to economy/regs
- **Geopolitical** Hong Kong risks

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Tomorrow Market Prediction: Simple Insights and a Real Plan for September 23, 2025 Hey there! Welcome back to Replete Equities. As always, I want you and me to look at the market’s ups and downs together and find out what matters for YOU—because that’s what counts. Let’s keep it simple, practical, and focus on a trading plan you can actually use tomorrow.

How Was the Market Today? Quick Recap
Let’s talk about what really happened. Today, the Nifty 50 dropped by about 125 points and ended at 25,202. The Sensex also slipped by 466 points, closing at 82,160.

Why? Honestly, it felt like a day when people wanted to lock in some profits—especially after the market recently climbed higher. The big story was all about the IT sector (think TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Wipro)—they fell because the US increased H-1B visa fees, making investors nervous about their future costs. Even big names like Reliance and Tata Motors weren’t safe from selling.

But (and here’s the bright spot!) some shares like Adani Enterprises, Bajaj Finance, and UltraTech Cement did quite well. Still, smaller and mid-sized stocks weren’t spared—profit booking was everywhere. Plus, the India VIX (I call this the market’s “nervous meter”) jumped up by nearly 6%, so expect some more bumpy rides ahead.

Here’s What to Watch: Clear Support & Resistance Levels
I know numbers can get confusing. Let’s keep it straightforward—here’s what I’ll watch with you tomorrow, using the latest data:

For Nifty 50
Support:
I see 25,200 as the first “safety net.” If things get more volatile, then 25,100 is the backup, and really watch out for 25,000 if the mood turns negative.

Resistance:
On the way up, 25,350 to 25,400 is the main hurdle right now as a lot of call options are expiring here—so it’ll take some work for Nifty to cross this range. If you do see a breakout, watch for 25,450 as the next area that could slow things down, thanks to heavy call writing.

My view? The Nifty could bounce from support, but unless we see a strong move above those resistance levels (and big volumes), I wouldn’t bet big on a big up day.

For Bank Nifty
Closed at 55,459 today.

Support: 55,000 is the most important “floor” for now. If it slips, then 54,800 catches my attention. These levels have a good cushion from put option buyers showing up strong.

Resistance: Resistance is around 55,300 to 55,400 as call writers are active, and if we get a strong move above, then look for action all the way to 56,000.

If you see Bank Nifty break cleanly above resistance, that’s a good sign. But if it falls below those support levels, it might be best to stand aside for a bit.

What Are Options Telling Us? (Kept Simple!)
Let’s stay real—option chain activity tells us what the bigger traders expect for tomorrow’s range:

In Nifty, the main “fight” is between 25,100 (lots of support—many puts) and 25,350-25,400 (lots of resistance—many calls). The market is likely to stay between these zones for now, as neither side has a clear win.

Heavy call option open interest at 25,400 makes this a stubborn resistance.

At the same time, open interest near 25,200 and support at 25,100 means many buyers are ready below.

The PCR (put-call ratio) is pretty neutral right now, showing neither the bulls nor the bears have a major upper hand.

For Bank Nifty, the action is similar:

Support at 55,000–54,800, resistance at 55,300–55,400, and next-level resistance near 56,000.

No strong trend yet—so range trading is still the safest approach.

Summary: Don’t expect the market to go wild unless you see a real breakout past these numbers. It’s a “wait, react, and protect your profits” kind of day.

Hot Topics and Headlines YOU Should Know
Here’s what really moved the market and might matter tomorrow:

US visa fee hike put pressure on IT shares. If more news drops, expect more drama there.

Some foreign investors picked up Indian stocks, especially hoping for good company profits soon.

India’s tax changes (GST) and a stable monsoon could quietly support the market in the weeks to come.

The US cut rates again, which sometimes makes global investors bolder in buying stocks.

Tomorrow, there’s no major IPO launching, but company splits (like Adani Power) could shake up some prices.

How I’d Plan MY Trades for Tomorrow (And How You Can Too!)
Here’s my real, personal plan for Tomorrow Market Prediction:

Nifty Range: I plan to buy if Nifty goes near 25,200 or even 25,100, with a stop below 25,000. I’ll only get aggressive if Nifty powers above 25,400 and stays there.

Bank Nifty: I’ll be careful if it drops below 55,000. If it pushes up through 55,400 and holds, then I might look for buys, potentially all the way to 56,000.

Stock Sectors: I’ll still stay away from IT for now—too much uncertainty with those visa headlines. Instead, I’ll keep my focus on sectors like consumption, industry, and companies that people still need even when things get shaky.

Market Sentiment: With VIX up, I’d use safer strategies. I won’t take big risks—just trade the range, protect profits, and wait for a clearer breakout.

The biggest lesson? Don’t force any trade—patience is profitable!

Final Thoughts—My Honest Take
Markets will always have their scary days and sideways moves. If you and I stick with our plan, cut losses quickly, and size up only when things are super clear, we’ll do better over time.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"4 years of applying to IPOs, taking out the principal, and keeping the profits for life. Current value of those profits: ~450k This is a follow-up to my [2024 post on another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1etkbad/3_years_of_applying_to_ipos_taking_out_the/).

I have been subscribing to IPOs (retail only) since 2021 and since the start I fixed the strategy: exit on listing regardless of the outcome. Take out the principal and keep the profit for lifetime. 

I have to admit I have deviated from that rule since last year and I have kept stocks like Tata Capital, Tata Tech, Bajaj HFL, etc. This is because I feel they'll do better in the long run. The Hyundai holding was an error and it proved good and so did the lone Kalpataru share.

I have 3 retail accounts (across me and my immediate family), so the first 3 images are from my family holdings. These demat accounts are only for IPOs, save the SETNIF50 holding you see in an image.

I do top-level research to form an opinion on all IPOs but over these 4 years, I have seen that markets are irrational. So, some bets go wrong, like for the ones listed below. Even then, impossible allotments like that of Jinkushal Industries recently results in negative listing. Which is why I have continued to stick to my strategy with the hope that in the long run, most of these keep growing. You can read more about my strategy on that other post.

While you don't see the discount listing issues here, I have listed them here: CarTrade, Nuvoco Vistas, Aptus, Sansera Engineering, ABSL AMC, PB Fintech, SJS Enterprises, PayTM, AGS Transact, Rainbow Children's Medicare, LIC, Keystone Realtors, Uniparts India, Digvi, Avalon Tech, Maoj Vaibhav, Updater Services, IRM Energy, Muthoot Microfin, Jana SFB, R K Swamy, Gopal Namkeen, Aadhar Housing Finance, Brigade Hotel Ventures, Leela, Ather Energy, Ajax Engineering, Carraro, and Hyundai. The total loss would be shy of about 80k.

Some stats:

* Out of the 631 applications across 3 retail accounts, I have been allotted 125 times. That's about 22% success rate
* If I didn't sell the allotted lots, I would be setting on a profit of 650k
* My best performing IPO is: IREDA (380%)
* My worst performing IPO is: TARSONS (-55%)",1760537639.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7c5e2
Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Not a fan of ipos but I'm generally not a big fan of IPOs because I don't see them as great long-term investments. However, lately, I've been hearing a lot about the growing popularity and brand recognition of JSW paints and cement from my friends in the construction industry. This has me thinking about whether the JSW Cement IPO might be an exception to my rule.
From what I've read, JSW Cement is positioning itself as a ""green"" cement company, which is an interesting angle given the growing focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing. They're reportedly India's largest producer of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), and their CO2 emissions are significantly lower than their competitors. This, combined with the overall infrastructure boom in India, seems to create a compelling growth story.
However, a closer look at their financials reveals some red flags. The company's revenue has been relatively flat over the last couple of years, and it actually posted a loss in the most recent fiscal year (FY25) after being profitable in the previous years. Their debt-to-equity ratio is also quite high, and their margins are lower than some of the industry leaders. The IPO proceeds are intended to fund new expansion projects and repay debt, which could be a positive, but it also highlights the company's high capital expenditure and leverage.
The IPO was subscribed around 8 times, with strong interest from institutional investors, but the retail portion saw a more moderate response. The GMP (Grey Market Premium) has been fluctuating, suggesting a somewhat cautious but stable listing.
So, for those of you who are more familiar with the cement industry or have experience with IPOs, what's your take on JSW Cement as a long-term investment?",1755111523.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1mpd9qu/not_a_fan_of_ipos_but/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"[IPO Analysis] EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd. Hey folks,

I started [helloquant ](https://helloquant.in)as a side project. Will talk about it later in details. One thing I realized is for IPO, there is no good website which is clean and give analysis in a straight forward manner. So, we are starting an IPO Analysis Series where we look at upcoming Indian IPOs through a **quantitative lens** — no fluff, just data, valuations, risks, and context.

Our first breakdown is on **EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd.** (incorp 1999), a company in the business of pre-engineered steel buildings and prefabricated structures. They also manufacture EPS (thermocol) blocks, sheets, and packaging products.

# 📌 IPO Details

* **Price Band**: ₹194–204
* **Issue Size**: ₹504 Cr (Fresh ₹300 Cr + OFS ₹204 Cr)
* **Current GMP**: \~₹20
* **Use of Proceeds**: Capex, working capital, debt repayment

# 📊 Financial Highlights

* Revenue CAGR: **31.4%** (highest among peers)
* PAT growth: **57%**
* ROE: **22.69%** | ROCE: **22.88%**
* EBITDA Margin: **10%+**

# 🔎 Valuation vs Peers

Peers: PENIND, INTERARCH, EVERESTIND, BEARDSELL

* **P/E** = 34.54 (rich vs peers)
* **ROE** = 22.7% (highest among peers)
* **WC Days** = 35 (very efficient)

# 🧮 Strengths

* Strong presence in a growing prefab construction market
* Diversified product mix (buildings + EPS)
* Expanding capacity with IPO proceeds
* Fastest revenue growth among peers

# ⚓ Anchors & Analyst Views

* Anchor investors include **WhiteOak, 360One, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley**
* Positive recommendations from **Reliance Securities, SBI Securities**

# ⚠️ Risks

* Volatility in raw material prices (steel dependency)
* Execution risks in expansion
* Competition from larger, established players

# 💡 Our Take

At the upper band, valuations look **expensive on P/E basis**, but strong ROE, efficient working capital, and anchor participation show confidence. Might be interesting for listing gains, but medium/long-term depends on execution.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"One Up On Wall Street - Part 1 Hi everyone,

I have been posting the summary of **One up on wall street** based on the set of books recommended in this [List](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaGrowthStocks/comments/1htigh6/10_mustread_books_for_investors/?share_id=WmXLPNoBwyvmqrzZzZ8gj&utm_name=ioscss). Starting with the summary of the introduction chapter from the one up on wall street. You can follow the continuation post from these links below.

The points here will be my interpretation of the book rather than what Peter Lynch is trying to teach, so follow it up with your own reading.

TLDR:

**If you have decided to pick stocks on your own then**

1. The **most useless information** about a stock is it's **price**
2. **Stop listening** to the **noise** including the so called professional Investors
3. Observe your surroundings the **best stock**s are always **around you** (liking)
4. Liking a company is not good enough reason to buy the stock, you need to do **your** **own research**(which is what he will be teaching in this book)
5. Even if the company is good never **overpay**
6. Have patience bulls and bears are not **everlasting**

The goal of this book according to **Peter Lynch** is Any Normal person (I am not sure about abnormal people, he didn't mention it in the book. if you are a weirdo then you are on your own i guess) can pick a stock better than a fund manager just by observing your surroundings. you don't have to listen to news, check fancy websites just observe what people are doing, where people are buying and so on.

He promises to teach us the readers(Normal persons) how to do that by pointing us towards few fundamentals like

1. Which numbers really count when we are looking at a stock and what do they mean
2. Guidelines for how to pick cyclical, turnaround and fast growing companies

To set a little bit of context here, This version of the book that all of us will find in bookshelves is the millennium edition that was updated and release in April 2000, right around the time of Dotcom bubble burst. So he talks a little about the Dotcom IPO frenzy without knowing the market is going to crash when the book hits the shelves (We can replace dotcom with AI for current period).

Initial conversation is about how neither bear market nor the bull market last forever and that patience is required in the stock market, people with patience will be rewarded in the end. Then the IPO's of the dotocm companies where the valuation were so high that many millionaires are forming in the valley right after their IPO without having to prove themselves, he cautions people who felt missed out on these IPOs that they are lucky since the prices were so high that only a few would have benefited since everyone else is paying so much with so little earning to show for it(**Never pay High**). One reason why these stocks were risky is that you cannot measure their P/E ratio since they didn't have the important component of the P/E called E, earnings which companies are supposed to have.

Peter tells despite all this drama surrounding him, he still invested only based on ancient fundamentals. It goes like this

* Company enters a market
* It earns money
* Then stock price increases
* Or a flawed company turns itself around

**The stock Price** is the most useless information you can find about a company. What the market pays for a stock this week or next week does not tell whether the company will succeed in 3 or 4 years down the line. If you have to follow any data about the company follow one useful information which is the **earnings** assuming if the company has any.

New Industries form in every time period, but only a handful of companies survive and Only very few become the top ones. you can't just pick a stock because the field is exciting, you need find a good company, even if a company is great you should never overpay.

He provides the example **Electronic Data Systems** whose P/E was 500 at the time which he notes would take five centuries to make your investments. This is nothing but people buying on the basis of Hope than fundamentals, to avoid this he provides three ideas.

I will be modifying the examples for our time rather than the dotcom period

1. Sell shovels and Pick when there is a gold rush
   * Rather than betting on which AI company will make or break just invest in the companies that makes the stuff required for the AI. (Chips, Data center, power supply, fiber optics and so on)
2. Invest in an old company that is starting a new vertical
   * Microsoft will survive on other verticals even if their investment in Chatgpt fails, same way they survived the smart phone fuck up. This give at least protection of capital for you.(Stock market doesn't guarantee anything other than ""you will lose your money for sure"" but possible)
3. Invest in Company that leverages AI to improve their business
   * Any company that uses the new technology to improve efficiency and profit in their existing business models  (Currently everyone is slapping AI on their products)

To find these companies one doesn't have to do any research, Just observing your workplace, home, surroundings, restaurants and so on.

To give an example from our current time, I went to **Zudio** casually one day just to stroll around, only to see a sea of people standing in line to bill at least 5 items each, then I went to upper floor to see huge crowd still shopping and trying out clothes with at least 5 items in hand(almost closing time). I though this is such a good business and they must be making a lot of profits. I came home to check if they are listed in the market to find Trent valued at 4.5K per share. Unfortunately for me I did not start investing years before when it was available at 200 a piece.

Just because you like a product they sell doesn't mean you should buy it, one ought keep a list of stocks they like then do the fundamentals analysis before buying it. The important things to notice are the company's

1. Future earning prospects
2. Competitive position (Moat)
3. Expansion plans

If it's a retail company like **Zudio** you need to figure out if it's nearing the end of expansion phase, which peter terms as late innings. since earnings will not grow multi fold as it did during the early expansion phase.

**Conclusion:** When i started this post, I though I would be summarizing what I read, but I may have over estimated my talent to summarize stuff and ended up writing another book about a book i read. Similar to those annoying videos on YouTube that summarizes movies. Provide me feedback whether this is helpful or not, feel free to ask Chatgpt to summarize my summary.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Thoughts on Waaree? With great fundamentals and futuristic growth, Waaree seems to be the one. But isn’t that overvalued and still trading above 2600+…

Do you guys think it’ll have a retracement or a dip?( Below 2k)

Edit:Every response to my post mostly focuses on the P/E ratio. I understand that this P/E is low compared to the entire sector. However, do you think the sector itself isn't overvalued? Right now, in India, sectors like solar, pharma, EV, and AI are considered futuristic, and retail investors are eager to capitalize on these opportunities, which may lead to overall industry overvaluation.

I still believe that stocks could experience a dip—perhaps in a day, a week, or even a few months—and I would consider this stock then. While the fundamentals are strong and the future looks promising, we can't simply rely on a low P/E ratio to justify purchasing stocks at any price.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Long term conviction/thesis for my stock picks All my holdings are LONG TERM only. I started serious direct stock investing from around March this year (so my returns look decent because of the run up since then). It represents 1/3rd of my total portfolio (1/3rd in MFs and 1/3rd in US equity). My goal is simple:- to buy and hold cash flow compounding machines for a long time.

Apar Industries - it was trading at a 52 week low and they were making high quality export level products. Now facing uncertainities due to tariffs.

Nuvama Wealth - major player in a fast growing sector of wealth management. Growing top line consistently at ~20% comprising mostly sticky recurring revenue. All this available at a PE of 24 and PEG < 1. Still a good buy imp, but a lot of competition in this sector.

Swiggy - I foolishly thought having everything in one platform might make customer acquisition cheaper and easier. But they are being out-executed by Zomato in every turn. I still believe this stock has more upside but not adding more.

PFC - Consistent compounder trading just about book value. Lending majorly to discoms so NPA isn't too high and growing revenue around 20%. Looking to add more as I see more growth due government push for capex and RBI's liquidity norms. I also see long term secular tailwinds for India's energy sector. (Plus div yield of 4%)

KPI Green - Growing top line at >50% and bottom line at 100% with PE of 30 in a sector with a lot of tailwinds such as renewables. No idea why this stock is so cheap. Looking to add more.

CAMS - a bet on increasing financialization of India and growth of SIPs in India. Trying toadd more toll gate businesses like this in my portfolio. Strong moat, dominant position in a duopoly with high switching costs. But growth is slowing and is not enough to sustain its current valuation.

CARE Ratings - again a low capex, high margin toll gate business with high barriers to entry. Credit rating agencies globally are considered one of the best businesses to own and always trade at a premium. Care Ratings is the fastest growing and cheapest rating agency in India so it was a no brainer. It is also backed by super investor Guy Spier.

PVR Inox - it is a turn around between. I believe movies are an integral part of India's growing out culture. And PVR Inox is a virtual monopoly in this space. But it is still a risky bet with a shaky balance sheet and shite quality of Indian movies today.

Coal India - monopoly in the coal space and available at a stupidly cheap valuation. High dividend yield. But margins depend on global coal prices.

Pricol - a monopoly in the instrument cluster space for two wheelers. I believe betting on two wheelers is safer than the auto space in India. Pricol is growing at almost 20% and I may add more if valuation stays or dips slightly.

Canara bank - trading below book value with decent growth in NII, low NPAs and high dividend yield. Looking to add more.

Stocks I am looking to add more in - KPI Green, Canara bank, Nuvama, Care Ratings, PFC.

Stocks I may exit after a year - Apar, Swiggy, Nestle, KEI.

Current Watchlist - NSDL (if it gets to IPO price), TD power systems (if it gets to 350-400 levels and tarrif concers are allayed), MCX (waiting for a dip), Adani Ports (due to the monopoly nature), Narayana Hrudalaya, Dr Agarwal's Healthcare.",1755929554.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxtsft

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"KRN Heat Exchanger IPO: A long-term play on the domestic growth story - a moneycontrol pro article. # The money raised through the fresh issue will be deployed to set up a greenfield facility

KRN is benefiting from the strong domestic demand

**Highlights** 

* Leading player in the domestic heat exchanger market
* Focus on customers and reliability help in securing premium clients
* Fresh issue (IPO Money) to provide capital and fuel growth
* Huge capacity expansion to support growth in the coming years

From a seasoned engineer — heading the operations at Lloyd Electric — to an entrepreneur, Santosh Kumar Yadav, has come a long way.

Sniffing an entrepreneurial opportunity in 2017, Yadav leveraged his extensive experience in the heat exchanger market to establish KRN Heat Exchanger with modest initial investment and operating capacity. Now he is ready to tap the capital market. KRN is a leading provider of commercial cooling products, which account for 98 percent of its revenue. The company serves industry giants such as Daikin, Blue Star, Voltas, and Carrier Aircon.

**Operating Matrix**

https://preview.redd.it/padqmnbztwqd1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=64f1b62fce5f5fe89204ce7bf1b13f8b9152a06d

**About the business**

Based at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, KRN Heat Exchanger is a leading manufacturer of fin and tube-type heat exchangers. Specialising in HVAC&R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration) applications, KRN offers a wide range of copper and aluminium products, including condenser coils, evaporator units, and fluid coils, to meet diverse market needs.

The company has quickly developed strong technical capabilities and strong competitive advantage with a customer-centric focus. In this segment, the company is now the largest player in India along with exposure to international markets.

**Leading Clients**

https://preview.redd.it/10xjrk51uwqd1.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cd820c0c027fea86d1e008a184b3d7c0432fbd

**Growth capex to support higher growth**

https://preview.redd.it/oahk7to3uwqd1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=5de15f42e858b9ae4c98bd84e5a3e835638eaabd

Its products and services are in huge demand. In the last five years, it had to expand manufacturing capacities and capabilities several times to meet demand. This time, it intends to play big and add significant capacities (6 times in comparison to present capacities), which will take care of growth over the next 3-4 years.  
KRN Heat Exchanger

Through the IPO, which is an entirely fresh issue of shares (raising Rs 342 crore), the company intends to deploy money in a new greenfield facility, having a total capex requirement of about Rs 280 crore. This facility is being developed keeping in mind the requirements of the exports market and emerging new technologies, providing huge scale and competitive advantage.

Having proven its capabilities in the domestic market, the company feels it has huge opportunities in export markets. KRN’s exports have grown from Rs 15 crore in fiscal 2022 to Rs 45 crore in fiscal 2024. They are expected to reach around Rs 80 crore in the current fiscal.

**Balance Sheet**

https://preview.redd.it/5xfsscg5uwqd1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=241fee132b32d96b318c1bfecfc9c15c631e4cc3

**Valuation**

Since the entire proceeds from the IPO will be used to develop new capacities, we value the business based on the core earnings. At the upper price band of Rs 220, the company is looking for a market capitalisation of Rs 1367 crore. However, if we take away the IPO money, cash in the books, and the capital work in progress or the money being deployed in the under-construction facility, it is valued at around Rs 1000 crore which is about 25 times its fiscal 2024 profits — quite reasonable in the light of growth and quality of the business.



# After Analysing RHP of KRN IPO(chatgpt) - OUTLOOK AND RISKS. 

**The company outlook:**

The business outlook for KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Limited, as detailed in their RHP, is positive but relies heavily on the HVAC industry and key customers. 

**Expansion Strategy:**

The company plans to expand its customer base, reducing dependence on its top 10 clients, who account for over 70% of revenue. It has already entered markets across 17 states in India and exports to 9 countries .

The company aims to increase its presence in markets like North America and Europe, as well as solidify its position in the Indian HVAC market .

**Innovation & Cost Efficiency:**

The company benefits from in-house manufacturing processes that allow better quality control and cost advantages compared to competitors who rely on external job work .

By keeping the entire product design, testing, and manufacturing under one roof, they are well-positioned to meet growing demand in a cost-effective manner .

**HVAC Industry Growth:**

The company is highly dependent on the HVAC industry, which is experiencing growth due to the increasing demand for energy-efficient and climate-control systems . However, any downturn in this industry or shifts in technology could adversely affect the company’s future growth .

Overall, the company is positioned for growth, with its strong foothold in the HVAC sector and plans for geographical expansion. However, challenges remain with reliance on key customers and market conditions in the HVAC industry.

  
**The Risk Factors:**

**Revenue Dependency on Key Customers:** 

A significant portion of the company's revenue (approximately 72.31% in FY 2024) comes from its top 10 customers, including Daikin Airconditioning India Private Limited, which alone contributed about 33.34% of revenue. A cancellation or reduction in orders from any of these customers could negatively affect the company​

**Lack of Long-term Contracts with Customers:** 

The company does not have long-term agreements with its customers. If customers decide to switch suppliers or decrease their orders, the company’s financial stability could be compromised​.

**HVAC Industry Dependency:** 

The company's revenue is heavily dependent on the HVAC industry. Any downturn in this industry, whether due to economic conditions, technological changes, or environmental concerns, could adversely affect the company’s growth and profitability​.

**Potential for Production Disruptions:**

The company relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials, and any delay or disruption in the supply chain could negatively impact operations​.

**Lack of Technical Support Agreements :** 

The company does not have formal technical support service agreements in place for machinery maintenance, which could lead to operational disruptions in case of technical breakdowns​.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Isn't RBL Bank severely undervalued? Yes, I know this is far from the best-run bank in India. Yes, it saw a dip in collection efficiency for microfinance loans (an industry-wide issue this quarter). Yes, it’s involved in unsecured retail lending.

...but the **price-to-book ratio is around 0.6.**

The fundamentals have steadily improved since the new management took over a few years ago. They’ve reduced risky wholesale lending, diversified the loan book, and increased the share of granular deposits. Despite a weak quarter, the bank remains profitable. Additionally, they earned approximately ₹163 crore from the Dam Capital Advisors IPO proceeds.

What could possibly go so wrong that these price levels aren’t attractive? What concerns about this bank are not already priced into the stock?

Could the fact that nobody is talking about this stock, perhaps because they’re too afraid to touch it, actually be a positive?

The markets experienced a significant downturn on Tuesday as Hyundai Motors' IPO opened at a 1% discount, leading to declines in Indian benchmark indices. The Sensex fell by 931 points (-1.15%), meanwhile the Nifty dropped by 311.40 points (-1.26%). With 36 of the 50 stocks in the index trading in the red, BEL and Tata Motors were notable losers, although gains in ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Reliance Industries offered some support.

  
The market decline is driven by fears of a U.S. recession, escalating geopolitical tensions, weak corporate earnings, and concerns about stock overvaluation. Investors are engaging in profit booking, while Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been selling shares amid global uncertainty. Additionally, SEBI's new regulatory changes on derivatives trading, rising crude oil prices, and concerns over upcoming U.S. economic data are adding to market volatility. Together, these factors are contributing to the downturn, prompting a cautious approach from investors.

So half of the stocks were suggested by a random dude on instagram and idk how but 99&#37; of the time, his suggestions were spot on. Apparently he was part of a trading company. I made crazy gains thru him, but I deleted my instagram account out of some personal reasons. After that I decided to start my own research and few of the stocks are result of my research. My first bet was Zomato which went really really well. So instead of consolidating the existing companies, I started buying new shares. I agree this was a dumb decision. Then I got busy in my exams and didn't have much time to research. So I bought shares just on the company's name. Some of these shares are Mahindra Logistics, Paras, Exide Industries, TVS Supply Chain and others. As you can see, most of them did decently well. Then I applied for Hyundai IPO with literally zero research. I thought since it's a big IPO of a big company, it'll eventually go up. I know, again a dumb decision, but here we are. Now the problem is, I can't figure out which ones to hold and which one to sell. As of now, I don't have time to research all of them. I will start studying finance & stock market soon, as it is included in my syllabus, but it'll start after 4-5 months. Until then I wanted a starting point regarding my portfolio.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"International Gemmological Institute Limited - Diamonds or Dust? International Gemmological Institute (IGI) is the largest diamond and jewelry certifying body in India with ~50% MS in India and ~33% global market share.

IGI is the second largest diamond certifying body after GIA, who created the modern grading of Diamonds (i.e. - 4C’s - Colour, Cut, Carat and Clarity). GIA on the other hand has over ~50% global market share with a substantial market share in USA.

IGI has the first mover advantage in grading Lab-grown Diamonds (LGD’s) where they have 65% market share.

IGI -

IGI has 3 entities - India, Belgium and Netherlands. Belgium and Netherlands entities were acquired post IPO for a consideration of ~155 million USD (~1300 crores).

India is the largest entity contributing over 80% of revenues and 95% of EBITDA in CY24, whereas Belgium and Netherlands have a smaller contribution.

98% of revenues comes from certifications and accreditions whereas 2 percent comes from training and education.

Certifications costs at 3-5 percent at wholesale level. Broadly certification cost are at 1000 rupee per report.

IGI’s unique proposition and asset light model results in over 73% EBITDA Margins and ~100% ROCE, amongst the top 1% company in India and globally in terms of margins and capital allocation.

IGI India -

IGI India caters to Top 9/10 jewelry chains in India ( except Tanishq which does in-house)

IGI certifies Natural Diamond, Lab Grown Diamonds, Jewelry and colored stones.



Margins for the company across segments are LGD > Natural Diamonds > Jewelry and Colored Stones

Margin profile in Domestic is at 72-73% EBITDA margins.

IGI overseas operations -

IGI has 2 subsidiaries - Belgium and Netherlands.

Belgium entities overseas Belgium and USA whereas Netherlands entity overseas Netherlands, China, Hong-Kong, Middle-East and other countries.

Currently, the overseas entities operate at a sub-optimal level resulting in operating margins at ~10% v/s India margins at 72-73% EBITDA margins.



Growth Indicators -

Growth in Lab-grown Diamonds -

From CY21-24, IGI grew on back of strong LGD growth at 30% CAGR in volumes and 29% / 34% / 37% in Revenue / EBITDA / PAT.

In-terms of diamond production 18% of total diamonds produced are now Lab-grown v/s 9% in 2019.

Lab-grown Diamonds boom has been led by limited product differentiation, product affordability and newer generations adoption.

The entire longer term thesis for IGI can be on the back of what thesis you subscribe to -

LGD continuing to replace Diamond market

Price Erosion in LGD making it a differentiated market v/s LGD.

Natural Diamonds losing their shine ?

Diamonds were meant to be forever, but with the exodus of LGD and affordable jewelry, will LGD replace and destroy diamonds forever or will the mighty old diamond make a comeback?

Natural Diamond Industry declined by 2.4 billion USD (~8% in CY23) with 50% decline led by wider adoption of LGD’s.



Natural Diamonds have also lost their ability as store of value with prices down ~40% from peak.



According to De Beers, among the world’s largest natural diamond company, the below chart shows supply coming down materially as natural diamond miners continue to try and artificially inflate prices below.



Lab-grown Diamonds have replaced a part of Natural Diamonds due to better affordability but lab grown diamonds pricing has seen a steep decline with a price correction of over 60% in CY24.



The steep decline in LGD poses challenges to IGI’s certification pricing and further declines in LGD prices cannot be ruled out owing to better manufacturing capabilities driving down prices further.

IGI had to drop prices in April-May of it’s certifications because of drop in LGD prices resulting in volume-pricing impact which is expected to continue for next 2 quarters.

While pricing has remained relatively stable over the last 9-10 months, any further sharp pricing decline can de-rail IGI’s growth trajectory.



The need for certification -

IGI is in a sweet spot where certification need is only rising for both natural and LGD with certification companies being disproportionate winners in the fight between Natural Diamonds and Lab-grown Diamonds.

With rise in LGD’s, the need for certification for natural diamonds is on the rise, with differentiation being one of the key selling points for natural diamonds

Lab-grown diamonds are on a nascent stage, where LGD certification is following Natural Diamond certification to separate it from lower end jewelry such as one with American Diamonds.

Key risks
-The key risk for IGI is a steep drop in LGD prices which makes certification costs unviable. 

Overseas subsidiaries have performed poorly in CY24 and if these entities don’t turn-around they will be a drag on both profitability and margins in the years to come.Margin headwinds especially in India is likely as the company is adding employees in order to cater to volumes increasing.Conclusion - IGI’s competitive advantages, unparalleled financial economics and strong presence in a fast growing segment makes it an interesting business to evaluate.

However with the ever-evolving LGD segment and sharp pricing fluctuations, it can easily turn tailwind into a headwind especially historically highest margins.

Whether IGI will benefit from LGD boom is a question mark at the moment. Only time will tell.

2.  IPOs are gold mines—if you’re strategic. In Japan, IPOs tend to soar because people love new things. Fujimoto made ¥200M (over $1.3M) this year trading IPOs. His trick? **Buy IPO shares just after release to avoid the rush, then trade them wisely. Be patient. Follow the market’s pulse.**

3.  Trends and gurus can mislead you. Fujimoto warns: **Following trends blindly leads to failure.**  
Most “hot tips” are outdated by the time you hear them. Even Warren Buffett’s moves can be manipulative. **Do your own research!**

  
4. The market rewards obsession. Fujimoto doesn’t just trade stocks—he lives them. From observing cargo trains to analyzing market data, he watches everything.   
**“The more you immerse yourself, the better your instincts become,”** he says.   


5. 5. **Learn from losses.** Fujimoto lost 75% of his wealth in the 1990s and everything in the 1995 earthquake. But at 66, he started over, learning online trading with zero computer skills. His wealth rebounded to ¥1.8B ($12M).   
""**Mistakes are inevitable. Resilience makes the difference.""**

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"IGI Earnings Call Summary I was tracking the lab grown diamonds (LGD) market looking for promising investment opportunities. And I came across the recent IGI (International Gemological Institute) results and the earnings call since it is one of the key players in LGD value chain. Here is a very short and very quick summary for anyone who is interested. 

Key Financial highlights:

* Revenue from Operations up 9.6% YoY
* PAT up 11% YoY
* Volume (# reports generated) up 27% YoY
* EBITDA margin at 65%
* Average Realise Price (ARP) down 11% YoY but up 7% QoQ

Key themes I gathered from the earnings call:

* They recently finished up all the legal work on their acquisition of IGI Netherlands and IGI Belgium under IGI India making IGI India the hub of worldwide operations. This was funded from the IPO in December 2024. The Netherlands unit did quite well, however Belgium faced some headwinds, they attributed this to the geopolitical unrest in Europe and are optimistic about its performance once the situation there improves.
* They are constantly seeing rising volumes and this trend is expected to last as well thus have upped their employee strength by \~14% (added 130 people) and are also building a new state of the art facility in Surat
* The LGDs industry is at an inflection point with growing adoption in India and the rest of the world, and they are hugely optimistic about it and are betting big on it. Because with LGDs comes a greater need for certification as proof of origin. (So if the perception of LGDs changes for worse they could take a big hit)
* For them volume growth is expected to outpace value growth, courtesy of increasing component of LGDs in their revenue mix
* On LGD price volatility (because the value of the diamonds is one of the factors in their pricing as well) they said they don't expect another steep fall like the one from a year ago, since the current level of production costs for growers has ensure a floor that supports stability in price.
* They are also making quite a few investments in process re-engineering and technology to support sustained growth and improved customer experience (few key things that I picked up were Digital certifications and blockchain traceability, automation where possible.
* On the effect of tariffs on their business, they said that as they are in services business there shouldn't be a direct impact but there will definitely be some impact due to the impact of movement of diamonds, but it shouldn't be much.",1745398649.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k5uh17/igi_earnings_call_summary/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Analysis of the healthcare sector in India! Fellow redditors, since all of you showcased so much love on my last post, I am here to contribute more to this sub and hopefully enhance the quality of posts here. Today, I am going to be doing an extensive analysis of the healthcare sector in India. I believe that this is a very underpenetrated zone with robust growth potential. 

Spoiler: For those who are looking for stock recommendations, I’m going to save you some time and tell you that there are none in this post. I am not going to step into the same zone as certain finfluencers and tell you guys what to buy since I am not an advisor, nor are most of them btw. I am going to be giving a broad overview of what I think the healthcare sector is going to look like in a few years, the growth triggers and the general valuations. 

For those who struggle with reading long posts, I would say this is the time for you to try and go to chat gpt to ask for a summary and for chatGPT to miss out on the majority of the statistics and points that I will try and put forth. This is exactly how you end up having weak convictions in businesses. 

The following are my personal views supported by market forecasts and statistics.

I am sure a lot of you must be seeing a significant consolidation in your portfolios for the past few months. It is also hard to point out exactly what triggers are impacting the market, I think it was overheated valuations, but some might say it was the US imposing tariffs, stronger dollar or reallocation to other undervalued markets. While some might complain about the market collapsing and that stocks will never reach the same levels again (not my comments but things I’ve read on this subreddit), I believe that this is a great time for accumulation. I know a lot of us might be struggling with the fact that you might be 100% invested in the markets, if that is the case then just hold on to fundamentally strong companies and you should be good. For those who have cash on hand, this is a golden opportunity to slowly accumulate. 

Now coming to the healthcare industry. What is interesting to watch in market downturns is the fact that because investor sentiment is low and the markets are fearful, people tend to offload stock from all sectors, even the ones that might be doing well and are growing at a good pace. The great thing about this sector is that it cannot be impacted much by foreign policies or tariffs unlike the IT sector. India remains a highly under-penetrated zone when it comes to hospitals and there is a huge demand for more infrastructure. 

https://preview.redd.it/p9apgjlfvpje1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e3a915fb377dc696f0a1921756a9fcd9285f5de

When you have a look at this image, you can clearly see the lack of infrastructure we have. This was also highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was a large shortfall of availability of beds in hospitals. Since our population is similar to China, I would assume that our basic requirements should be close to theirs. I would not say that we should expect the average to go all the way up to 50 but I would assume somewhere around the 35 scale should be the target. This is again my own analysis; I would hope that we can at least achieve the world average. This is trigger number one.

Furthermore, since we all know the AQI levels around the country, which btw I don’t think will become better anytime soon, this will lead to further health issues in the long term. These are long term opportunities. Take major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Haryana where air quality is at its worst, people residing there will definitely need to seek medical services in the long term, nobody can sustain such harmful toxins. This is exactly why hospitals in North India are growing at a much faster pace when compared to any other side in India. 

https://preview.redd.it/pouj1e2dvpje1.jpg?width=1180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14aad56bafaf19aeb1520fdcba8a35c58c5844ca

Even if we consider a mid-point growth of 10% Y-o-Y, then we can see just how big of a market this would be going in the future. The good thing about this is that we are currently at a stage where hospitals are rapidly expanding and you will see a lot of private chains making several acquisitions, this is all because they know the opportunities that lie ahead. Another major thing to consider is that government only has a fixed amount of Capex that they can deploy to fund or expand hospitals, which is why the burden is on the private sector to grow and fill the necessary gaps, this is really beneficial because we have a lot of private players who are already listed and some who are ready for an IPO. This is exactly why you will be seeing a shift in the market share that private hospitals have. Below is the forecasted change. 

[I believe that this is a very conservative forecast](https://preview.redd.it/q613rfawupje1.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e97a161c55ddcc21ccbae53bc3f6744e51b1efc)

Another important thing to keep an eye out for is the fact that the government has launched the ‘Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)’. For those of you who are not aware of this policy, this is an initiative that the government has taken to provide health coverage to all senior citizens of the age 70 years and above irrespective of income. This is aimed to benefit around 4.5 crore families. This is huge! This means that going forward people would prefer to seek private healthcare because they have a coverage of up to 5 lakhs. You can read more about this here:[AB PM-JAY | Prime minister of India](https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-health-coverage-to-all-senior-citizens-of-the-age-70-years-and-above-irrespective-of-income-under-ayushman-bharat-pradhan-mantri-jan-arogya-yojana-ab-pm-jay/). It has not even been a full year since the rollout began, which means that going forward we can see a lot more people visiting private hospitals. This is trigger number two. 

https://preview.redd.it/eetra9y3vpje1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcdf7bb4285de28e9bc37232b3e7f25f75126d34

There is clearly a very low concentration of private sector penetration, and this graph helps us visualize the market that is yet to be penetrated. 

Trigger number three is how cheap our medical facilities are when compared to the rest of the world. India holds a big price moat over the rest of the world when it comes to medical services. This is why we are witnessing a wave of medical tourism in India. This was something that was also mentioned in Budget 2025, the idea of “Heal in India”. This is an initiative that has the potential to bring a lot of money to India and obviously the government sees that and is trying to provide streamlined e-visa facilities along with visa-fee waivers for certain tourist groups. I would highly encourage you to read this: [Press Release: Press Information Bureau](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2099519). Below are the price comparisons between major countries to prices in India and you can clearly see the difference. 

https://preview.redd.it/0xzwggizupje1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2be4c9b78103c114f8a6815fa75fe27a23286ff

Medical tourism is growing at a very high pace at the moment. There was a time during the pandemic where it had slipped significantly, but we are starting to see a strong bounceback. I believe that if the sector plays its card correctly, then we can see a massive inflow of money. You can compare this to medical tourism in Korea as well; there is a significant incentive for people to fly to Korea for plastic surgeries due to the significant price difference. Their economy has massively benefitted from this! I believe that there are opportunities for our market to grow beyond that scale just because of our price competitiveness. 

[I believe that this forecast is pretty conservative, and that India has the potential to attract more than 30 lakh tourists by 2030e. ](https://preview.redd.it/qvhh5cr0vpje1.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceccd913db372a47f3819f4dd700f17c8e8e4512)

India is also starting to see more people buying health cover than before. This is very interesting because more people holding health insurance means that people would be visiting for every health issue they have instead of trying to seek cheap remedies and fixing the issue by themselves. Companies are also starting to offer health insurance as part of their employees' overall package, this means that more people are going to be holding more insurance policies going forward.

Something to keep an eye out for is that several healthcare companies have seen their shares significantly fall in the past months, even though most of the companies reported decent to good earnings. It is also important to point out that unlike a lot of sectors, healthcare is not cyclical, people don’t choose when they want to fall sick, therefore these are stocks which, regardless of market conditions, should be reporting numbers that are in-line with expectations. 

Some of the companies are available at great valuation at this point and there are also some that are trading at crazy prices. I would highly recommend that you do your due diligence of which business you want to invest in and try keeping an eye out for the points that I have highlighted. Good companies would be expanding and trying to capture the medical tourism market. Look for their geographical locations, the markets they are trying to cover and the level of specializations that they offer at their hospitals. I believe that this sector gets overlooked quite often by investors, however I feel that going forward, it has the opportunity to generate great wealth for investors. 

Of course, I cannot cover every single incentive or trigger for this industry in a single post, however I hope I have given you some coverage of what stage our country is currently at and what we can expect going forward. I would encourage you to do your own research to develop your own conviction. 

Would love to hear your opinions about this post and sector in the comments!

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Why I am bullish on zomato? 

Zomato is a food tech company headquartered in Gurugram, India. It was founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah. The company started as a restaurant discovery platform but has since expanded to become a comprehensive food and dining platform. Zomato operates in over 25 countries and has a presence in more than 10,000 cities globally.

Zomato's business model is based on providing a platform for customers to search for and discover restaurants in their area, view menus, and place orders for delivery or pickup. The company also provides reviews and ratings for restaurants, as well as the ability for customers to make reservations at participating establishments.

In recent years, Zomato has also expanded into the food delivery space, offering a range of delivery options to customers. The company's delivery service operates in over 600 cities globally, and it partners with restaurants and delivery partners to offer a wide range of cuisines and dishes.

In addition to its core business, Zomato has also launched a number of other services and initiatives. These include Zomato Gold, a subscription-based service that provides members with exclusive discounts and offers at participating restaurants, as well as Zomato Events, which offers customers the ability to book tickets for food-related events and experiences.

In terms of revenue, Zomato generates revenue through a variety of channels, including commissions on orders placed through its platform, subscription fees for its premium services, and advertising revenue from participating restaurants.

Zomato has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the company reporting revenue growth of 38% in the 2021 financial year. The company has also been expanding its global footprint, with a particular focus on emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East.

In 2021, Zomato went public, listing on the Indian stock exchange. The company's IPO was oversubscribed by more than 38 times, indicating strong investor interest in the company's future prospects.

Zomato has established itself as a leading player in the food and dining industry, with a comprehensive platform that provides a range of services to both customers and participating restaurants. The company's strong growth and expanding global presence suggest that it is well-positioned to continue to grow and evolve in the years to come.

Revenue: Zomato's revenue has been consistently increasing year over year, with a reported revenue of INR 24.8 billion in the 2021 financial year, up 38% from the previous year. This growth is driven by an increase in order volumes, expansion into new markets, and the success of its delivery service.

Expenses: Zomato's expenses have also increased, largely due to increased investments in marketing, technology, and expansion into new markets. The company has also been investing heavily in its delivery service, which has resulted in higher costs related to delivery and logistics.

Profitability: Zomato has not yet turned a profit, reporting a net loss of INR 8.1 billion in the 2021 financial year. However, the company has been making progress towards profitability, with its net loss decreasing by 66% compared to the previous year. Zomato's gross profit margin has also been increasing, which suggests that the company is improving its operational efficiency.

Cash flow: Zomato's cash flow position has improved significantly, with the company reporting a positive cash flow from operations in the 2021 financial year. This suggests that the company is generating cash from its core business activities, which is a positive sign for investors.

Capital structure: Zomato has a significant amount of debt on its balance sheet, with total liabilities of INR 24.9 billion as of March 2021. The company has also raised significant equity capital through its recent IPO, which will help it fund future growth and expansion initiatives.

Overall, Zomato is a rapidly growing company that is investing heavily in its business to capture market share and expand its reach. While the company has not yet turned a profit, its improving financial position and strong revenue growth suggest that it is on the path to profitability in the future. However, the company's heavy reliance on debt and ongoing investments may present some risks for investors, particularly in a competitive and rapidly evolving market",1680503221.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/12abp4g/why_i_am_bullish_on_zomato/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Tata Motors or Hyundai As expected, Hyundai share price increased by 5%  after listing at a discount. But buying now should be avoided since many retailers would start booking profits once the price goes above the IPO band. The right time to enter would be when the selling volume drops and settles down at a range where the share price is not that volatile.

Also the competition in the automobile industry is massive, so I would say Tata Motors is a much better bet considering that they have ventured into the EV segment as well. 800-850 is an excellent price to accumulate/buy Tata Motors shares.

\--

There’s a bit of a weird understanding around company ownership in India. If you’re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company’s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company’s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a “promoter”, you end up effectively owning \[1\] the company.

There’s quite a bit of confusion and conflict around this understanding. Sometimes the founder and CEO of a company owning 10% doesn’t want to be called the promoter, but is [forced to](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vijay-shekhar-sharma-paytm-directors-face-sebi-show-cause-notices-over-ipo-breaches-12806852.html). Other times an investor who owns 17% [cannot remove](https://www.medianama.com/2021/10/223-explained-zee-invesco-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a promoter holding less than 4%.

Being a promoter is a state of being. You don’t need a large stake. If you’re calling the shots day-to-day, you’re a promoter. It works the other way too. If you don’t control a company just yet, but want to, you better get yourself put down as a promoter. It’s like drawing a superpower from within the soul of the company that gives you the permission and access to decide how it works.

This week, the Burman family, who are the promoters of the Ayurvedic brand Dabur, also [became the promoters](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/burman-family-acquires-control-become-promoters-of-religare-enterprises-125022001226_1.html) of Religare Enterprises, a financial services conglomerate. They were in the market to own about 51% of Religare, but their offer to buy the public’s shares failed miserably. No matter! They still own 25% of its shares, but more importantly, after a long-drawn conflict, they passed the company’s vibe check and managed to call themselves its promoters.

# An offer that you can refuse

Before this week, Religare did not have a promoter. They did, [once upon a time](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/from-singh-brothers-to-burman-brothers-religares-promoter-blues-continue/articleshow/105266662.cms?from=mdr), but for the last seven years they didn’t. This isn’t a problem. There are large companies like ITC and HDFC Bank without a promoter, and all it means is that there is no one shareholder calling the shots on how the company operates. The shareholders with varying levels of ownership have some representation on the board, which then assigns the CEO, and the CEO reports to the board just as a regular employee would. (And when the CEO leaves, their son or nephew doesn’t take over.)

In September 2023, the Burmans owned \~21% of Religare, which they bought over a few years from the open market. They intended to buy 4% more and exceed 25% in total ownership. There’s a SEBI mandate around such high ownership. If you happen to own 25% of a company’s shares, you have to then offer to buy at least 26% of its remaining shares as well. The idea is that this gives *you* the opportunity to own a controlling stake in the company, and also gives people who may not like you the opportunity to sell their stock to you and get out.

If you’re a serious buyer, your offer to the public had better be more than the stock’s market price. We’re talking about a publicly listed company here—people can sell their shares and move on anyway. The only reason they’d sell to you is if you offered them a better-than-market price for their shares.

When the Burman family first announced their intention to run an offer, Religare’s stock price was around ₹270. The Burmans offered ₹235, a good 13% lower.

The Burmans announced the offer one-and-a-half years back, but it actually happened just last week. And [it failed](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/EFAC8052-C655-4C3B-BC69-8B8C5D55B04A-134530.pdf)! They were out to buy ₹2,116 crore of Religare stock. Shareholders agreed to sell only 0.25% of that, about ₹5.4 crore.

That’s what makes the Burman family’s successful takeover a little weird. They made a shitty offer, it didn’t go through, and yet they control Religare? Tell me if being a promoter isn’t a state of being.

# She does not give up

There are two things I want to mention about Rashmi Saluja, one of them totally irrelevant to this story.

1. Until last week, she was the executive chairperson of Religare.
2. She was [deboarded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-kicks-out-troublesome-head-of-a-top-financial-company-as-she-was-rude/articleshow/108285668.cms?from=mdr) from an Air India flight for being rude to the crew.

Saluja had been the chairperson since [December 2019](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/a7a2e5c3-6e03-4b41-998b-bd6ad741896a.pdf) (the deboarding happened last year) at a time when Religare was almost a dead company because its founders [stole](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-court-frames-criminal-conspiracy-charges-former-religare-enterprises-promoters-loss-firm-9784145/) from the company. I don’t know how Religare turned around, but it did. Saluja had been the chairperson all this while so looks like she did a [good job](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rashmi-saluja-steered-religare-2-0-through-upheaval-changed-firms-fortunes/articleshow/93994326.cms?from=mdr) with it.

Saluja did not want the Burmans to take over Religare. Makes sense to me. If you’re a corporate turnaround artist at a financial services company, you wouldn’t want the company to be taken over by a billionaire family selling [adulterated honey](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/honey-fraud-our-response-to-statements-from-dabur-patanjali-74512). But just how far do you go to keep your job?

Pretty far. Here’s a bit from [earlier this month](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rashmi-saluja-moves-court-again-religare-board-fights-back-3746738/) from the Financial Express:

>The battle for control of Religare Enterprises (REL) has started looking like a never-ending soap opera. On Tuesday, Rashmi Saluja, the ousted executive chairperson of REL, made the first move by filing a fresh writ petition in the Delhi High Court, seeking to quash the open offer by the Burman family-led entities. This marks the seventh legal attempt by her to stall the takeover process. The court is expected to hear her petition on Wednesday (today).

Seventh legal attempt! Saluja does not give up. \[2\]

# Fit and proper!

Religare is a holding company for a brokerage, an insurance company, and an NBFC, among other smaller businesses. For the Burman family to become the promoter, they had to get the approval of the regulator for each line of business. That’s SEBI for being a broker, IRDAI for insurance, and RBI for the NBFC.

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, but someone looking to buy a company like Religare, cannot apply directly to the regulators for approval. Instead, the company itself has to go to its regulators and say “hey this guy’s looking to buy me, are you okay if we let him run an offer for our shareholders to consider?”. The company does have some discretion here. If a potential acquirer isn’t credible, it need not go to the regulators and waste their time. But the Burmans already owned 21% of Religare, obviously had the means to buy more, so Religare didn’t really have any room for discretion.

And yet, Religare’s board, led by Saluja, decided that it did not want to take the Burmans’ offer to the regulators for approval. Apparently the Burmans did not meet the criteria that owners and executives for financial companies must be “fit and proper”.

Fit and proper? That sounds familiar. [We spoke about](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=SEBI%20wanted%20the%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%20which%20is%20just%20a%20bunch%20of%20floor%20criteria%20for%20stuff%20like%20not%20having%20defrauded%20anyone%20or%20being%20a%20criminal.%20Embassy%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20argument%20was%20that%20its%20CEO%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%3F!) these criteria last year when a company argued that their CEO need not be fit and proper. Here Religare is arguing that the potential buyer absolutely must be fit and proper, and that it was deciding that they were not. Surely the Burmans must be in some financial soup? No?

From[ From a Mint report](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bid-to-block-religare-acquisition-burman-family-slams-false-fir-linking-dabur-group-to-mahadev-betting-app-case-11699955913805.html):

>Members of the Dabur group have issued a rebuttal after reports linked its chairman and director to the Mahadev betting app case. The Mumbai Police has reportedly booked 32 people – including Mohit Burman and Gaurav Burman – under various sections of fraud and gambling. A spokesperson for the Burman family however dubbed it a ‘baseless’ accusation that happened to coincide with their bid to acquire Religare Enterprises.

>“We have not received any formal communication on any such FIR. However, we have sighted the FIR which is being circulated to media houses. The FIR is patently false and baseless. Nothing could be further from the truth than as wrongly stated in the FIR,” the spokesperson said.

The Burmans announced that it was going to do an open offer and in a few weeks there were reports that they had an FIR registered against them in an unrelated betting scam. \[3\] Religare used these reports to decide that the Burmans weren’t fit and proper, and wouldn’t even apply for approval to the regulators for good measure.

The Burmans then went to SEBI about this, who eventually forced Religare to actually apply for approval. [This was in June 2024](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2024/interim-order-cum-show-cause-notice-in-the-matter-of-religare-enterprises-limited_84286.html), a good nine months after the Burman family’s initial offer announcement. \[4\]

# Stall, stall, stall

Every year, usually sometime between July and September, every listed company in India holds their annual general meeting. This meeting is when companies are able to get all their important shareholders in one room and have them vote on things that need their approval to go through. Shareholders can also ask the board and executives questions (or share their unsolicited opinions) about the company.

Religare’s annual meeting was scheduled for sometime in September 2024, but the board delayed it to December. From [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/religare-enterprises-agm-delay-shareholders-rashmi-saluja-investors-burman-family-dabur-11724591594022.html):

>Three institutional shareholders said they were unhappy with the decision to postpone the AGM, especially since the company has given no explanation. The delay becomes crucial as chairperson Rashmi Saluja was up for reappointment at this AGM, initially scheduled for September.

>\[…\]

>Saluja is the only non-independent director on the Religare board and, therefore, comes up for retirement at each AGM. The vote to reappoint her will now take place in December after the company secured approval to defer the AGM by three months.

Saluja needed to win the shareholder vote to be reappointed as the chairperson of Religare. This vote is usually a formality, shareholders like to go for whoever’s being presented. Saluja probably didn’t want to risk it, so the meeting was pushed.

Then in December, some random guy filed a public interest litigation (?) in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur—a city that Religare has absolutely nothing to do with—and the court [asked to](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/madhya-pradesh-hc-stays-religare-enterprises-agm-in-response-to-pil/119722) wait on the meeting scheduled for 31 December (which by itself is a weird day to hold a meeting). In January, the court [finally allowed](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/madhya-pradesh-high-court-dismisses-pil-religare-agm-rashmi-saluja-125010900673_1.html) the meeting to proceed because it figured that the litigation was BS.

The meeting was then scheduled again for February, and this was challenged in court again! This time by Saluja herself in the Delhi High Court. The court [refused](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/delhi-hc-rejects-rashmi-saluja-s-plea-to-halt-religare-enterprises-agm-125020601716_1.html) to halt the meeting.

On 7 February, the meeting finally took place and [here’s what happened](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-suspense-at-agm-over-reappointment-of-saluja-3741671/):

>The annual general meeting (AGM) of Religare Enterprises on Friday took an interesting turn after chairperson Rashmi Saluja stopped the discussion on her reappointment (agenda 2), stating that she was not liable to retire by rotation, said sources.

>“So, we can ignore resolution number 2,” she said. When an independent director present at the meeting contested her decision, she dismissed the intervention, saying that his remarks should be taken on record.

Saluja still doesn’t give up! In the meeting, she told everyone that she wasn’t due to retire, and so there was no need for everyone to vote on her reappointment. How thoughtful of her to save everyone’s time.

Of course, that wasn’t the end of it. In the physical meeting, she managed to stop people from voting against her by making sure the vote itself didn’t happen. But voting was held online for shareholders who weren’t at the meeting and two days later [97%](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-over-97-religare-shareholders-reject-salujas-reappointment-3744393/) of Religare’s shareholders had voted against her reappointment. She was *finally* removed from her position as executive chairperson.

# It’s a state of being

Back to the Burmans. They wanted to become the promoters of Religare and decide how it should operate. Initially, Religare’s board of directors were against this and resisted to the extent that they could. Later it was just Saluja who remained obstinate to the extent of not even letting the Burmans’ offer reach the shareholders.

Becoming the promoter isn’t just about owning a large stake. Sure, yes, more shares don’t hurt. And beyond 51% there’s not a lot anyone else can do. But with Saluja no longer a board member, there was no one to stop the Burman family from becoming a promoter. So they became the promoter! Like I said, being a promoter is a state of being.

If Saluja hadn’t been booted out, whoever knows what would’ve happened? With the Burmans’ offer practically rejected by shareholders, there is no way she would’ve let Religare name them as the promoters. Eventually, sure, the Burmans would have succeeded. But that would cost time, legal fees, and maybe a lot more money for yet another long-drawn offer.

# Stay out of jail card

Why was Saluja hell bent on halting the Burmans’ offer? Maybe because she paid herself a lot! She held too much sway within the company and figured out a way to earn many multiples more than other executives at the same level. From [the Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/religare-finvest-issued-esops-to-rashmi-saluja-a-day-after-burmans-open-offer/articleshow/106497688.cms?from=mdr):

>\[…\] Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award, documents reviewed by ET reveal.

>The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore. Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.

Highest paid executive in *Indian corporate history*! \[5\] Most of Saluja’s compensation came from the employee stock options pool of Religare’s subsidiaries, worth anywhere between ₹630 crore to ₹740 crore ($73m to $86m). Her stake was so high that it would represent 8% of Religare’s NBFC! The stock option pool is usually between 5–10%, meant to serve as an incentive for *all* employees to work to get the stock price up and stick around for longer. Saluja hogged the entire thing.

Okay, fighting to stay around as the highest paid executive in Indian corporate history would be alluring. But come on, the annual general meeting was seven days away, and she sued the company she was the chairperson at! And asked shareholders to casually ignore something they were to vote on! That’s extreme.

The Burman family have been [demanding](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/burman-family-demands-sebi-investigation-in-allotment-of-8-esops-shares-to-rfl-chairman-rashmi-saluja-11704286617650.html) an investigation into Saluja’s compensation. If the numbers are true, and they seem to be, Saluja has almost certainly been defrauding the company and its investors. With the Burmans running the company, I wouldn’t be surprised if any documentation around her compensation reached the investigator as a neatly formatted PDF of evidence. That makes her extreme behaviour make a [little bit more](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ed-summons-religare-chairperson-rashmi-saluja-for-questioning/articleshow/116183872.cms?from=mdr) sense.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I use “ownership” for promoters liberally, even though they don’t technically own the company. In everyday conversation I think the distinction doesn’t matter.

\[2\] This better be the name of any biography that happens to be written about Saluja.

\[3\] There’s some [dumb stuff happening](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/remote-controlled-plaint-cops-may-quiz-rashmi-saluja/articleshow/118461248.cms) here that I wouldn’t even be able to scratch the surface of.

\[5\] I like how the Economic Times emphasises this, but this may or may not be true! I doubt Saluja would keep getting those stock options every year for life.

In a world where 70% of companies aren’t beating the index, it’s clear that not all mid and small caps are created equal. The tide that lifted all boats during the bull run has receded, and now it’s about finding the right boat.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Stallion India Fluorochemicals IPO 1. Company fundamentals

Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited, established in 2002, specializes in the sale of refrigerant, industrial gases, and other related fluorochemical products.

The company's primary business includes debulking, blending, and processing refrigerant and industrial gases, offering products such as pre-filled cans and small cylinders/containers.

Between FY 22 and FY 24, Stallion India Fluorochemicals reported an average three-year Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of approximately 20% and 26%, respectively. The net profit registered a sharp rise of 51.6% year-on-year (YoY) from ₹9.75 crore in FY 23 to ₹14.78 crore in FY 24.

The company also has multiple manufacturing facilities across India with 4 facilities located in Khalapur (Maharashtra), Ghiloth (Rajasthan), Manesar (Haryana) and Panvel (Maharashtra). 

2. Issue size and split

The size of the IPO is small at Rs. 199.45 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,850 for retail investors.

The IPO has majority fresh issue of 1.79 crore shares aggregating to Rs 160.73 crores and Offer For Sale (OFS) component of 0.43 crore shares aggregating to Rs 38.72 crores.

This is a green flag since we know that the promoters are not offloading too many shares.

3. Brand name and experienced Management

Stallion is a prominent player in the flourochemicals market with 10% market share.

The company has a professional management and experienced leadership of the promoter Mr. Shazad Sheriar Rustomji.

He has a good understanding of supply chain logistics with over 3 decades of experience in the field of refrigerants and specialty chemicals.

4. Valuation

The company is fairly priced with a P/E ratio of 48x, based on FY24 earnings post the equity share issuance.

It is a small cap company with a market cap of around Rs. 714 crore

The  valuation is reasonable, given the company's past growth, future growth prospects, and the profitability of the company.

5. Clear Use of Proceeds

The proceeds from the IPO will be used to support increased working capital needs, fund capital expenditures for its semiconductor and specialty gas debulking and blending facilities in Maharashtra, finance capital expenditures for its refrigerant debulking and blending facility in Andhra Pradesh, and to cover general corporate expenses.

The company will also not receive any proceeds from the OFS, as those will go to the selling promoter after deducting offer-related expenses and applicable taxes.

6. Strong underwriting team

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

Sarthi Capital Advisors is the sole book running leaf manager of the IPO, while Bigshare Services is the registrar for the issue.

7. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

On day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion is undersubscribed with only 0.31x subscription showing lack of institutional buyers.

Anchor investors also showed less interest in the IPO with only six anchor investors in the anchor book namely Saint Capital Fund, Ashika Global Securities, Craft Emerging Market Fund, Mint Focussed Growth Fund, Ashika India Select Fund, and Leading Light Fund.

Verdict:

This IPO is balanced but mixed with both pros and cons, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.

 MobiKwik recorded impressive Year-over-Year *(y-o-y)* growth in Q2FY25, with revenue from operations increasing by 42%, rising from INR 207 Cr in Q2FY24 to **INR 294 Cr**. The company experienced a remarkable surge in payments Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), which soared by **267.3%***(y-o-y)*, driven by a robust expansion in both user and merchant bases. Despite these positive numbers, profitability faced challenges, highlighted by a Contribution Margin improvement to 40.2% and a loss in Profit After Tax (PAT) of INR 36 Cr, largely due to ongoing investments for future growth.  
  
In the Quarter-over-Quarter (q-o-q) analysis, MobiKwik's revenue from operations decreased by 15.1%, dropping from INR 342 Cr in Q1FY25 to INR **291 Cr** in Q2FY25. This decline has been attributed to strategic adjustments in credit product offerings and changes in commercial agreements. Despite the revenue drop, there were positive cost efficiency indicators; the Gross Margin for Payment Services improved to 19.2%, while EBITDA saw a significant (q-o-q) increase of 205%, from INR 2 Cr in Q1FY25 to INR 7 Cr in Q2FY25.  
  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the payments business reflect strong user and merchant growth, with registered users increasing to 167 million and the merchant base expanding to 4.4 million. Payments GMV reached INR 283 billion, showing both *(y-o-y)* and *(q-o-q)* growth. However, the take rate slightly declined to 0.66% from 0.68%. In the Financial Services segment, the Digital Credit GMV fell to INR 16.3 billion, indicating a more cautious disbursement strategy, even as the gross margin improved to 48%.  
  
Strategic initiatives included scaling back the ""ZIP"" credit product to address macroeconomic challenges and introducing new financial products such as FD-backed RuPay credit cards. Operational milestones also included achieving industry-leading payment gross margins and successfully listing on the NSE and BSE on December 18, 2024, following the IPO. Overall, while MobiKwik navigates some quarter-over-quarter challenges, its long-term growth strategies and user base expansion position it favorably for future growth.​

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Stock market is like test cricket, play the long-term game In India's tour of Australia during 2003-04, Rahul Dravid’s batting was a cornerstone of India’s fightback. The Indian team's vice-captain in the 2003-04 series, had a traumatic tour to Australia in India's previous outing there in 1999-2000, with scores of 35, 6, 9, 14, 19, and 0 in the four tests played there.

His incredible double century of 233 runs in the second Test at Adelaide helped India secure a total of 523 runs, trailing only by 33 runs. In the next innings, Ajit Agarkar helped India by taking 6 wickets, and the Aussies were bowled out for 196. Dravid emerged as a hero once again in the chase as he smashed an unbeaten 72 to propel India to a 6-wicket victory. This might seem like an ordinary win on the surface, but this win meant a lot to Indian cricket fans.

Rahul Dravid boasts a remarkable Test career. He is the fourth-highest run-scorer in Test cricket with 13,288 runs, second only to Sachin Tendulkar among Indians. Moreover, he faced more deliveries than any other batter in Test history, a testament to his incredible resilience in the crease. Batting at the crucial number three position, Dravid amassed 10,524 runs, surpassing any other batter in history at that position.

His sixteen-year international career saw Dravid being the only batsman to have a test cricket partnership with 700 other batsmen, while other batsmen have not even been able to play 650+ partnerships. He also had an exceptional overseas record with a batting average of over 53 and 8 out of his 11 man-of-the-match awards being won outside India.

Dravid faced more balls than other batsmen in tests, and in test cricket, not losing wickets is more important than scoring boundaries or hitting every ball. Dravid himself told in 2011, 'My attitude towards batting was simple: the bowler had to earn my wicket. I told myself that I had to bat at least 30 overs in a Test. If I didn't do that, I had failed. I would do it one way or the other.'

Why is the stock market similar to test cricket?

Just like test cricket, investing also has a simple formula of not investing in every stock available on the market, watching stock prices every hour, or buying and selling daily. Instead, an investor needs to be patient enough to preserve capital by not making brash decisions and committing to sticking with the fundamentals.

A lot of post-COVID investors are scared of seeing the movements in today's market, thinking that they are doing something wrong if they are not making huge profits daily. Focusing on long-term sustainability in the face of volatility is paramount.

Just like Rahul Dravid had his lows in 1999, several quality stocks such as Reliance Industries Limited, Bank of Baroda, Asian Paints, Titan, Shriram Finance, Sun Pharma, NTPC, GAIL etc have been beaten down in today's market. Drawing parallels to Dravid's focus on solid technique and disciplined batting, investors should prioritize fundamental analysis of companies over short-term trends and market hype.

In fact, many of the above-mentioned stocks are the biggest wealth generators since their IPO. So stay invested in companies with strong fundamentals, sound financials, and a competitive advantage. Discipline, patience, strong foundation matter more for an investor than chasing short-term and quick gains.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Laxmi Dental IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Based on the below parameters, the IPO has been reviewed:

**1. Strong Company Fundamentals**

Laxmi Dental is a leading dental healthcare provider in India, offering a range of dental services including dental implants, orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry, and more. The company has a pan-India presence with a network of clinics.

The company's revenue grew by 19.75% from ₹161.63 crore in FY23 to ₹193.56 crore in FY24. Even better is that the profits saw a remarkable turnaround, from ₹4.16 crore loss in FY23 to a profit of ₹25.23 crore in FY24, marking an improvement of 706.49%.

The company has also announced that it has secured ₹314 crore from anchor investors ahead of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹407 - ₹428 per share

**2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors**

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion of Laxmi Dental remains undersubscribed with only 0.44 times subscribed or 0.59 times, according to various sources.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

As of Laxmi Dental, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (MF), ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Kotak MF, Mirae Asset MF, Tata MF, Birla Sunlife Insurance, Max Life Insurance, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, Al Mehwar Commercial Investments and Natixis Investment Managers are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

**3. Issue size and split**

The fresh issue size should preferably not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Laxmi Dental's ₹698.06 Cr worth IPO consists of fresh issuance of 0.32 crore equity shares worth ₹138.00 crores and offer for sale of 1.31 crore shares aggregating to Rs 560.06 crores. The split here is 19% fresh issue and 81% OFS. Less than 50% fresh issue is a mediocre number and doesn't bring much credibility to the IPO.

**4. Brand name and experienced Management**

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

Laxmi Dental's leadership team comprises individuals with extensive experience in the dental industry:

* **Mr. Rajesh Khakhar and Mr. Sameer Merchant:** Founder Mr. Khakhar along with co-founder Mr. Merchant has been instrumental and played a pivotal role in providing advanced orthodontic solutions, contributing significantly to the company's growth and bringing advancements in Digital Dentistry and introducing new technologies.

**5. Attractive Valuation**

At the upper price band company is valuing at a P/E of 94.11x. Also based on FY24 earnings, the P/E ratio rises to 130.87, indicating that the issue is priced aggressively. 

As per the high valuation, the earnings and profits growth also have to grow similarly so that the valuation is justified.

**6. Use of proceeds**

The company plans to utilize ₹138 crore from the fresh issue to support several strategic objectives, including the repayment or prepayment, in full or part, of certain outstanding borrowings by the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Additionally, as per the RHP, funds will be allocated toward capital expenditure requirements, such as the acquisition of new machinery for the company and its subsidiary, Bizdent Devices Private Limited. The rest of the amount will be utilized by the company for general corporate purposes.

**Verdict:**

The IPO is worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736856511.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i14mp2/laxmi_dental_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth_diving_in/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Standard Glass Lining IPO: What’s the scene? Worth diving in? Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are from personal observations. I’m not a SEBI-registered investor, kindly do your research before making investment decisions.

Last minute quick IPO analysis

1. Strong Company Fundamentals

Standard Glass Lining Technology provides a wide range of solutions that cover design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, installation, commissioning, and the establishment of standard operating procedures for pharmaceutical and chemical producers on a turnkey basis.

The company's revenue grew from ₹240.2 crore in FY22 to ₹543.7 crore in FY24, reflecting a CAGR of 50.5%. Similarly, PAT increased from ₹25.1 crore to ₹60.0 crore, with a CAGR of 55%, supported by its strategic partnerships and inorganic acquisitions.

Standard Glass Lining announced that it has secured ₹123 crore from anchor investors in advance of its issue opening. Standard Glass Lining IPO price band has been fixed at ₹133 - ₹140 per share.

2. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

As of the closing day of IPO, QIBs oversubscribed by issue by 4.67 times.

But it's also important to track and make sure that QIBs show early interest in the IPO instead of pitching in the list minute.

Also watch out which mutual fund houses are investing in the IPO, if American firms such as Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard, etc invest, then there are better chances of getting better returns on investment.

In this case ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), Kotak MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, 3P Investment Managers, Kotak Infinity Fund - Class AC, ITI MF, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amansa Holdings, and Clarus Capital are the anchor investors for the IPO from whom an amount of Rs. 123 crores was raised.

However, a contrary example here is One97 IPO (Paytm), which had interest from several American players such as Vanguard and even Warren Buffet. However, many of them sold major portions of their investments, and Paytm’s share price is now several times lower than the listing price.

3. Issue size and split

It is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. The larger the issue size and the lower the fresh issue size, the more digging needs to be done.

Standard Glass Lining Technology's ₹410.05 crore-worth IPO consists of a fresh issuance of equity shares worth ₹210 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to 1.43 crore shares worth Rs. 200.05 crores by its promoters and other selling stakeholders. More than 50% fresh issue is a decent number and brings credibility to the IPO.

4. Brand name and experienced Management

A skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company’s long-term growth.

SGTL has experienced people in the management such as:

Mr. Nageswara Rao Kandula: Managing Director with over three decades of experience in creating glass-lined products that meet international standards for various chemically aggressive applications.

Mrs. Krishna Veni Kandula: Executive Director contributing to the company's strategic direction and operations.

Mr. Venkata Mohana Rao Katragadda: Executive Director involved in overseeing the company's engineering and manufacturing processes.

5. Attractive Valuation

At the upper price band company is valuing at P/E of 43.01x (against an industry average of 52x), with an EV/EBITDA of 30.08x and market cap of ₹2792 crores.

This reasonable valuation relative to its peers is a huge green flag.

6. Use of proceeds

The company plans to use ₹130 crore from the fresh issue to repay debts and allocate ₹30 crore for investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, S2 Engineering Industry.

Clearly defined use of proceeds is another reason to invest in the IPO.

Verdict: After a long time, we see an IPO that's worth applying. 100% worth applying even if you don't take the high GMP into account.",1736329987.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hwgjv3/standard_glass_lining_ipo_whats_the_scene_worth/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"IPO and Market Segments 1. When you’re looking at an upcoming IPO, what are the most important factors to analyse before jumping in? Aside from company fundamentals, what role does market sentiment play, and how much weight should be placed on industry outlook?
2. What’s the best way for retail investors to increase their chances of getting an IPO allotment? I’ve heard applying through multiple Demat accounts helps, but are there any other strategies worth trying?
3. What methods or tools do businesses use to identify the most profitable market segments? Are surveys and data analytics the best approach, or do companies still rely on traditional techniques like customer interviews and focus groups?
4. How do successful businesses adjust their marketing strategy to cater to different market segments? For example, how would a brand approach advertising to different income groups or regions without losing its core identity?
5. How important is market segmentation for a company’s growth? Are there any case studies of businesses that used segmentation to grow rapidly, especially in competitive industries?

Thinking Hats Entertainment Solutions, which has a price band set between ₹42 and ₹44 per share, totaling an issue size of 34,29,000 shares. For retail investors like me, the minimum investment required is ₹1,32,000 for 3,000 shares. I’ve noticed substantial interest in this IPO, as it has already been subscribed 48.36 times overall, with an impressive 64.53 times in the retail segment. Given this high demand, I expect the stock to list above ₹44 on October 3, 2024. If it lists at ₹50, I could realize a gain of ₹18,000; at ₹52, my gain might increase to ₹24,000; and if it reaches ₹55, I could potentially earn as much as ₹33,000.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"IPO Investing: Risks and Rewards of Buying New Stocks Investing in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is an enticing opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a company’s public journey. The potential to reap significant rewards draws many investors, but the journey is fraught with risks. A deep understanding of the IPO process, the associated rewards, and the inherent risks can help investors make more informed decisions.

**The IPO Process: From Private to Public**  
When a private company decides to go public, it undergoes a multi-step process that transforms it into a publicly traded entity:

1. **Preparation:** The company partners with an investment bank (the underwriter) to initiate the IPO process. This stage involves setting a preliminary offering price, conducting due diligence, and drafting a prospectus, which is a detailed document outlining the company’s business model, financials, and potential risks.
2. **Regulatory Approval:** Before offering shares to the public, the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and gain approval. This process ensures all necessary disclosures are made, safeguarding potential investors.
3. **Marketing:** A critical phase in the IPO process is the “roadshow,” where the company and its underwriters present the IPO to institutional investors. This phase helps gauge interest and determines the final offering price based on demand.
4. **IPO Day:** On the designated day, the company’s shares are listed on a public exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Trading begins, and retail investors can purchase shares at the market price, which may significantly differ from the initial offering price depending on market demand.

**Rewards of IPO Investing**

1. **Early Access to Growth:** One of the primary attractions of IPO investing is the opportunity to invest in a company during its early stages of public trading. If the company operates in a high-growth sector or has a strong business model, early investors can benefit from the company’s expansion and increasing market value.
2. **Potential for High Returns:** Some IPOs offer substantial returns quickly, especially for companies that are innovative or disrupt their industries. A well-timed investment in such companies can lead to significant gains as the company captures market attention.
3. **Portfolio Diversification:** Investing in IPOs allows investors to add new, potentially high-growth companies to their portfolios. This diversification can be especially beneficial for investors looking to expand into emerging or rapidly growing sectors.

**Risks of IPO Investing**

1. **Volatility:** IPO stocks are known for their price volatility, particularly in the early days of trading. While a stock might surge on the first day due to high demand, it’s not uncommon for the price to fall sharply soon after as the market reassesses the company’s value.
2. **Lack of Historical Data:** Unlike established companies, IPOs lack extensive historical data, making it challenging for investors to evaluate the company’s performance and potential accurately. Investors must rely on limited financial data and projections, which can be risky.
3. **Lock-Up Periods:** In some cases, early investors, such as company insiders, are subject to lock-up periods during which they cannot sell their shares. Once these periods end, the market may experience a surge in share supply, leading to downward pressure on the stock price.

**Post-IPO Volatility**  
The period following an IPO is often marked by significant volatility. This volatility is driven by several factors, including market sentiment, media coverage, and the initial enthusiasm of investors. For example, stocks like Snapchat (SNAP) and Facebook (FB) experienced sharp declines after their IPOs as initial excitement faded and investors began scrutinizing their business models more closely. This post-IPO period can be particularly challenging, as prices can swing wildly based on investor perceptions and external market conditions.

**Google’s IPO**

Google’s IPO in 2004 is often cited as one of the most successful IPOs in history. The company was profitable at the time of its IPO, and its stock has appreciated significantly since then, providing early investors with substantial returns. Google’s dominance in the search engine market and its ability to generate revenue from advertising contributed to its strong post-IPO performance.

**WeWork’s IPO**

WeWork’s attempted IPO in 2019 is an example of an IPO gone wrong. Initially valued at nearly $47 billion, the company’s IPO was withdrawn after intense scrutiny revealed significant financial losses and concerns about corporate governance. The company’s valuation plummeted, and it remains a cautionary tale for investors.

**Evaluating an IPO**  
When considering investing in an IPO, it’s crucial to evaluate several key factors:

1. **Financial Health:** Analyze the company’s financial statements, profitability, and growth prospects. Companies with strong revenue growth and profitability are often better candidates for IPO investments.
2. **Industry Position:** Assess the company’s position within its industry. Is it a leader, or does it face significant competition? Companies with a competitive advantage in a growing industry may offer better investment opportunities.
3. **Use of Proceeds:** Understand how the company plans to use the funds raised through the IPO. Are they investing in growth, paying off debt, or simply cashing out early investors? The intended use of funds can provide insight into the company’s future prospects.
4. **Management Team:** Evaluate the experience and track record of the company’s management team. Strong leadership is often a key indicator of a company’s potential success.",1725341480.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1f7s928/ipo_investing_risks_and_rewards_of_buying_new/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Is participating in an IPO more likely to become a valuable asset that enhances your investment portfolio, or could it turn into a burden due to potential risks and market volatility?







 Participating in an IPO can be both an asset and a burden, depending on various factors:

# IPO as an Asset:

1. **Potential for High Returns:**
   * If the company performs well post-IPO, the stock price may increase significantly, providing substantial returns. For early investors, this can be a valuable addition to their portfolio.
2. **Ownership in Promising Companies:**
   * Investing in an IPO gives you a chance to own shares in a company that may have strong growth potential. If the company thrives, your investment can appreciate considerably over time.
3. **Diversification:**
   * An IPO can help diversify your portfolio, especially if the company operates in a new or emerging industry. This can balance your risk across different sectors.

# IPO as a Burden:

1. **High Risk and Volatility:**
   * IPOs are often accompanied by significant volatility. If the market response is negative, the stock price can drop quickly, leading to potential losses for investors.
2. **Overvaluation:**
   * Some IPOs are overhyped, leading to inflated valuations. If the company fails to meet market expectations, the stock price could decline, turning your investment into a financial burden.
3. **Lack of Information:**
   * Unlike established companies, IPOs provide limited historical data, making it harder to assess the company’s true value and growth potential. This uncertainty can increase the risk of your investment becoming a burden.

# Conclusion:

Whether an IPO becomes an asset or a burden largely depends on your research, the company's long-term potential, and risk tolerance. An IPO can be a valuable asset if you are well-informed and the company succeeds. However, if the company struggles or the stock is overvalued, it may burden your portfolio.

Current value of those profits: ~450k This is a follow-up to my [2024 post on another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1etkbad/3_years_of_applying_to_ipos_taking_out_the/).

I have been subscribing to IPOs (retail only) since 2021 and since the start I fixed the strategy: exit on listing regardless of the outcome. Take out the principal and keep the profit for lifetime. 

I have to admit I have deviated from that rule since last year and I have kept stocks like Tata Capital, Tata Tech, Bajaj HFL, etc. This is because I feel they'll do better in the long run. The Hyundai holding was an error and it proved good and so did the lone Kalpataru share.

I have 3 retail accounts (across me and my immediate family), so the first 3 images are from my family holdings. These demat accounts are only for IPOs, save the SETNIF50 holding you see in an image.

I do top-level research to form an opinion on all IPOs but over these 4 years, I have seen that markets are irrational. So, some bets go wrong, like for the ones listed below. Even then, impossible allotments like that of Jinkushal Industries recently results in negative listing. Which is why I have continued to stick to my strategy with the hope that in the long run, most of these keep growing. You can read more about my strategy on that other post.

While you don't see the discount listing issues here, I have listed them here: CarTrade, Nuvoco Vistas, Aptus, Sansera Engineering, ABSL AMC, PB Fintech, SJS Enterprises, PayTM, AGS Transact, Rainbow Children's Medicare, LIC, Keystone Realtors, Uniparts India, Digvi, Avalon Tech, Maoj Vaibhav, Updater Services, IRM Energy, Muthoot Microfin, Jana SFB, R K Swamy, Gopal Namkeen, Aadhar Housing Finance, Brigade Hotel Ventures, Leela, Ather Energy, Ajax Engineering, Carraro, and Hyundai. The total loss would be shy of about 80k.

Some stats:

* Out of the 631 applications across 3 retail accounts, I have been allotted 125 times. That's about 22% success rate
* If I didn't sell the allotted lots, I would be setting on a profit of 650k
* My best performing IPO is: IREDA (380%)

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Reduced IPO size as investors think current valuation not attractive enough to sell, says Mamaearth The current investors of Mamaearth (Honasa Consumer), which opens for IPO subscription on October 31, feel the company's current valuation is not convincing enough for them to sell shares immediately.

That means investors like Peak XV Partners and Evolvence, who have either opted out of Mamaearth's offer-for-sale (OFS) or have reduced the number of shares they are willing to sell, see more upside and will hold the shares longer to bag better returns after it lists on the stock exchanges.

The optimism is understandable because Mamaearth’s current valuation of Rs 10,423 crore (around $1.25 billion) is unchanged from what it commanded during its fundraise in January 2022. In fact, the $1.25 billion valuation that Mamaearth is eyeing from its public market debut is a steep discount, of about 20-25 percent, from $1.5-$1.7 billion that it was seeking during its pre-IPO round of $150 million in August.

Even though Mamaearth's pre-IPO round did not happen, such rounds -- which involve a component of secondary sales -- are already done at a discount of 25-30 percent.

“On the OFS portion, investors thought that at this value it is not as attractive to sell. It is, of course, attractive for investors to buy and hence the decrease in the size of the IPO,” Arvind Vashishtha, MD, Citi Investment Banking, India, a book running lead manager for Honasa Consumer, said at a company event in Mumbai on October 26.

Kotak Mahindra, JM Financial and JPMorgan are the other lead managers for Honasa, whose IPO price band has been fixed at Rs 308-324 per share.

Vashishtha’s comments come at a time when Mamaearth (Honasa Consumer) has trimmed the size of its public offering by about 10 percent, meaning it is raising lesser capital than it wished to earlier.

As indicated in its updated red herring prospectus (RHP), Mamaearth has scaled down its primary capital raise to Rs 365 crore, from Rs 400 crore earlier. The company plans to use most of the proceeds to increase brand awareness.

Even the secondary component will see fewer shares of Honasa being traded.

Mamaearth’s early investors – Shilpa Shetty Kundra, Rishabh Harsh Mariwala, Fireside Ventures, Sofina, Stellaris Venture Partners, Kunal Bahl, Rohit Kumar Bansal and the Alaghs – will together offload only 4.13 million shares instead of 4.68 million shares as planned earlier.

Evolvence and Peak XV Partners, the largest external shareholder in Mamaearth, will not be diluting their stake in the offer-for-sale component.

“Like Varun (Alagh) said, the net invested capital was enough to fuel the growth of the business for the next two years, which also tells you about the asset light model of the business which will deliver growth,” Vashishtha said.

Momspresso shuttered

Gurugram-based Mamaearth has also been making efforts to improve its financial health. In FY22, the company clocked Rs 943 crore in revenues which helped it earn a profit of Rs 14 crore, but it slipped into losses in FY23.

In the fiscal year gone by, Mamaearth managed to grow its top line by 58 percent to Rs 1,493 crore but ended the year with a loss of Rs 151 crore. The drag was largely because of an impairment loss on goodwill which amounted to Rs 155 crore on the back of shutting down Momspresso.

“We had a certain vision on how it will be able to add efficiencies through the content-to-commerce funnel in our business…but after working on it, and spending a fair bit of management bandwidth, we realised that we don't see it to be able to create the value that it was supposed to create in the longer term and it was also bleeding our overall P&L (profit and loss) statement,” Varun Alagh, co-founder and CEO, Honasa Consumer said.

“We don't expect to see that impairment on Momspresso any further because we have actually shut the business down,” CEO Alagh added.",1698336829.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/17h02kp/reduced_ipo_size_as_investors_think_current/
Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Why I think IREDA will be a multi-bagger with 300% potential I think IREDA is a Multi-bagger stock that can grow by 300-400% in around 1-2years. Here are my reasons.

This is **not** a copy-paste, but entirely my own research. Source of most of the company data is Red Herring Prospectus available [here](https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/nov-2023/indian-renewable-energy-development-agency-limited-rhp_79087.html) but other relvent info is my personal research and understanding of the industry.

This is shared for educational purposes. Both mine and yours. I had no plans to write this, but when I researched and wrote points for my own investment, it become detailed enough that I thought of putting slightly more effort and making it into an article.

# Business model

&#x200B;

* IREDA is a central govt company made in 1987 to specifically give loans to renewable energy projects in India.
* Currently, it is the largest renewable energy financing company in India and have given out loans nearing 50000crores.
* IREDA's business is quite simple to understand yet many do not understand. They basically takes loans at 6.23% interest and then use that money to give loans to big renewable energy projects at average interest of around 10%, thus profiting 4% of everything they borrow!
* It is beneficial for companies that take these loans too as 10% is still a much lower interest rate than many other business loans from other sources. Thus win-win.
* People see the large debt and is wary of investing in a company with debt, that maybe true for normal companies but not for finance companies. Here they are all very good debt and this is exactly how all financial companies make money. More debt means more money to lend, and make more money.
* Their borrowing rate is the lowest among their peers. They borrow about half from domestic sources like RBI and bonds and the other half from foreign green investors including Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Asian Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement and the World Bank.
* The average cost of borrowing of IREDA is 6.23% in 2023. Other financing companies like REC limited have 6.96% and Power Finance Corporation Limited have 7.1% interest for the loans they borrow. Being able to borrow for such low rates, even less than Fixed-Deposits is the biggest advantage for a finance company.

&#x200B;

[The largest solar farm in the world is in Bhadla, Rajasthan. Funded partially by IREDA.](https://preview.redd.it/rpa6taypzv2c1.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c4930fab9dde7431ec802b622872eaa8233db18)

&#x200B;

# Why Low risk

# 

* Their main customers are large solar power plants and wind mills. More than 46% of their customers have made a legal agreement with the government(PPA) for the price at which govt will buy electricity from them. This is a permanent agreement that cannot be altered. This agreement was done to encourage renewable energy investments in India.
* So, a company that started in 2014 may have an agreement to sell electricity at a higher rate than a company that started in 2019 because cost of investment was higher in 2014.
* This basically guarantees profits no matter which year a renewable energy company was started as this fixed price means these solar/wind companies are guaranteed to get revenue from govt and thus guaranteed to pay their loans. There have been couple of instances of state govts wanting to get out of this agreement like in Andra Pradesh, but the govt eventually lost the case in court.
* The Andhra Pradesh high court gave order in 2022 that power contracts cannot be renegotiated and asked the state to clear dues estimated at Rs 30,000 crore to renewable energy generators in six weeks.
* But apart from that 93.4% of the loans are secured with collateral, so if the company is unable to pay in the worst case, IREDA can liquidate their collateral to recover money.
* 99.6% of the loan taking customers have taken compulsory insurance against natural disasters like Earthquake, flood, cyclone etc. So, there is no risk from disasters.
* 94.3% of the loans are given on floating interest rate, meaning the interest-payment is linked to inflation, thus there is no inflation risk to IREDA.
* 20 biggest customers account for 40% of the total loans given.
* IREDA has given loans in 23 states, so the political risk is spread across India.
* Only 1.66% of the loans given have turned out to be Non performing assets(NPAs). The net NPAs exhibited improvement, decreasing from 3.12% to 1.66% in FY23
* Out of this 1.6%, more than 70% were the loans given to Biomass plants and hydro plants, both of which were a learning experience for the company. The solar and wind are the main areas of expected growth in next 6 years, so I think NPA percentage will further come down.

# Why high value

# 

* Generally, Govt PSUs are huge companies in the 50k+ range market cap. But this one is a 8k market cap company. It is basically a government startup that is in a highly lucrative field that is about to blow up.
* Government companies are generally inefficient at doing complicated projects. Like HAL has to make fighterjets. Mazagon have to make ships.  All of them are too complicated, and easy for govt company to messup. But here it is a simple business model with low number of employees required.
* They just have 175 employees, but with an average experience of 18years! Basically like a startup, but focused on one thing only.
* Government companies that has too many customers are also generally inefficient like Air India, Railways or BSNL. But, here they have one of the lowest number of customers. Thus it is easy for a govt company to manage and give good service.
* Govt is currently looking to monetize its companies and earn dividends every year. So, new guidelines says all central public sector enterprise are required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth. IREDA is a profit making company for a long time. Thus, it will give good dividend in future too.
* Govt companies generally lists showing their actual value, and is not incentivized to list at blown up valuations. Here the net worth of the company is 6,580 crore. And the market cap is 8600 crore at Rs32 per share. Considering stock market is forward looking, there is huge scope for growth.
* India has committed to make 500GW of renewable energy by 2030. That is MASSIVE. India's total energy consumption from all sources currently is for example 190GW.
* India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 70.10 GW as of July 2023
* IREDA was the financier of 22GW of renewable energy in India as of now including partially financing the largest solar power plant in the world.
* Prime minister Modi had infused 1500 crore just last year into IREDA to fast up the growth of renewable energy. This shows clear govt support for this company. But anyway my point is that 1500 crore out of 6500 crore networth of the company is direct funds from last year given for free by govt.
* Even after this IPO, 75% of the stock will still be owned by the central government, thus they are committed in the growth of this company.
* IREDA also fully owns a 50MW solar power plant in Kerala that generates 28crore per year revenue.

&#x200B;

* 58000 crore worth of money was used to apply for IREDA IPO of just 2150 crore. Last week saw the biggest IPOs of this year. 5 IPOs that came in the week totaling 2.6lakh crore, total of 2.6lakh crore were invested. This is largest amount ever invested in a week in Indian history.
* Among these 5 stocks, IREDA will be the first to get listed, and there is  gap for others to be listed.
* More than 2.5lakh crore of this locked-up capital will be unfrozen just before IREDA is listed.
* This can cause it to show unprecedented demand when all of these people who have not got any IPO will look at buying the first IPO that got listed.
* But it will take people some time to realize this value, and stocks are forward looking, so I think in around 1-2years people will realize the potential and the price will skyrocket.
* Two years ago a similar PSU company IRFC which lends money to Railways went for IPO. It was priced at 26 rupees. But got listed at a loss of 3.5%. Its share price increase to 90 when people realized its value.
* IRFC was only subscribed 3x by QIBs. This time IREDA is 104x subscription from QIBs. There is clear interests from banks, mutual funds and govt institutions for investing in IREDA with long term view.
* IRFC lends only to railways. The scope of IREDA is substantially bigger, and is at the right time when renewable has finally become viable.
* Currently there is a trend of PSUs generally skyrocketing few years after IPO. Look at what happened to Irfc, Rvnl, IRCTC and Mazgaon.

# Growth

IREDA has enough space to grow in the next 6 years. And even at 5x the IPO price, it will be a company under 50k crore market capitalization. Since stock market is forward looking, it is possible that big funds will also go long on this much before than the actual value of the company reaches there.  And the size of the company is small enough for it to get influenced by the big funds.

This is a highly scalable data-driven business with very low risk of lending. Like, you know exactly what a solar panel will cost, and how much money it will produce over the years, so you are unlikely to give bad loans. In other financing companies, the risk is high like if you give loans to an airline or for making an ebike manufacturing factory, or give out personal loans, data is not the same for each loan-taker even in same industry. So, it is possible one ebike company makes profit while other do not. But that is not the case with solar or wind energy.

In one way I am happy I am getting to buy this stock at undervalued prices, but I am also mad at the government for selling 25% stake in such a profit making good company for loot prices. They could have got full subscription even at double the price. So, why sell low?

In general, this looks like a very good stock for long term value investing. There are so many upsides but very little downsides. I am going for long in this one.

REASON FOR APPLYING: So i apply to mostly all good ipos of atleast 5 lots. In the morning of first day ipo when i wake up, not sure what was on my mind, i applied, but considering the risk i only applied for 1 lot.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"BAJAJ Housing Finance IPO, This is what you need to do after Listing.  BAJAJ Housing Finance Valuation Check

1. At IPO price, market cap will be at Rs. 58k Cr. IPO is valued at P/Bx of 3.2x
2. Other large size peers like LIC Housing, PNB Housing, Canfin Housing are available at P/B 1.3-2.7x.
3. Smaller players like Aadhar, Aavas, Aptus and Home Finance are available at range of 3.3x to 4.8x.
4. Last 3 years growth - AUM growth of 31% CAGR over FY22-24 with 56% PAT CAGR
5. BHFL has lowest GNPA & NNPA in the industry (best asset quality)

So, considering all parameters - its presence in housing finance & other financing space, its superior growth, and best operational metrics along with Top class proven Promoters - BHFL will attract Premium Valuations.

Listing Price View - As per current GMP  it is likely to List around 100% Gains i.e., Rs. 140-150 range vs issue price of Rs. 70/-.

With such listing, it will be available at P/B of above 6x. Leaves limited upside growth.

Sell on Listing - Price above Rs. 130-140

Hold on Listing - Incase of bad listing with 30-60%.

Fresh Buying - Only below Rs. 100-110 range or else I will wait for market to settle down & wait for price discovery because after a good listing gains, hardly any immediate upside is left.

Even though it's a good company, no point in FOMO. Rather I will now focus on other Housing finance company to see if any re-rating possible in other players.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"IFCI owns ₹13,000 Cr worth of NSE stock - but trades at ₹64. This could be India's biggest value unlock story. Most people think of IFCI Ltd as a dusty PSU relic. But here’s what the market is missing - and why it might be the deepest value play on the NSE IPO. Recent article on MoneyControl (https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ifci-s-buried-treasure-the-rs-25-000-crore-stake-in-nse-could-change-its-fate-13211734.html) got me thinking..

**The Hidden Goldmine:**

* IFCI owns 52.86% of SHCIL (Stock Holding Corporation of India)
* SHCIL owns 11 crore shares in NSE = 4.444% stake
* NSE unlisted valuation = **₹2,285/share** → Market cap \~₹5.65 lakh crore
* IFCI’s effective stake in NSE = 2.3493% → worth ₹13,286 crore

**Per Share Impact:**

* IFCI has 269.4 crore shares outstanding
* NSE stake alone is worth ₹49.31 per share
* Current share price = ₹63.98 (02/07/2025 closing)
* **NSE holding accounts for 77% of IFCI’s current value**

**Total Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Intrinsic Value = ₹62.49/share:**

* ₹49.31 – Indirect NSE stake
* ₹8.72 – Value from SHCIL’s own operations
* ₹4.46 – Net asset value from IFCI’s own book

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* NSE IPO expected in FY26
* Government-approved merger of SHCIL into IFCI
* ₹500 crore capital infusion from Government of India
* Monetisation of stake or direct listing could crystallise hidden value

**Why It’s Not Priced In Yet:**

* Legacy NPA baggage and weak lending book
* PSU label and governance inertia
* Market has not fully accounted for indirect asset holding

**The Opportunity:**  
This isn’t an earnings turnaround story - it’s a holding company trading well below the value of its assets. If either the NSE IPO or SHCIL merger executes, IFCI could be re-rated significantly.

**My Conclusion:**  Downside is **protected near ₹60–62**, due to strong asset backing; Long-term re-rating possible if IFCI transforms from legacy lender to a focused asset-holding entity

Is this just another forgotten PSU, or the best value bet in India’s financial sector?

**Industry overview**  
  
  
India is a global production hub for two-wheelers – **a total of \~19.5 Mn 2W were produced in India in FY 2023 contributing 15-20% of the world’s total 2W production, making it the second largest 2W producer in the world after China**. Of the total production, \~4 Mn units were exported. **16-17 Mn units were sold domestically**. Globally, India is the second largest 2W market in terms of domestic sales volumes. Value of 2W domestic market size in India was Rs 1.4-1.6 Tn (US$17-20 Bn) in FY 2023. The TAM for 2W export from India is between Rs 7-8 Lakh cr. Markets like Africa, South East Asia provide an export opportunity for Indian OEM’s which further increases their TAM with an **export opportunity of around 100 million unit globally.**  
  
**E2W penetration in India is expected to expand from approximately 5.4%** ( China 85-90%) of domestic 2W registrations sales in Fiscal 2024 **to 41-56% of the domestic 2W** sales volume by Fiscal 2028, according to the Redseer Report. EVs have lower total cost of ownership (TCO) vs ICE vehicles, for e.g., electric two wheelers (that have led EV adoption in India) **have \~55% lower TCO vs their ICE counterparts** over the life of the vehicle. This is driven by lower fuel costs (roughly 1/10th of ICE) and other savings on vehicle spends (maintenance, registration subsidies)  
  
High fuel prices and the resulting total cost of ownership (TCO) have limited **2W penetration to \~160 2Ws per ‘000 people in India in CY 2022**, which is much lower than some of the SEA countries ( China 300-350, Indonesia 450-470), suggesting a large headroom for 2W growth ahead. Industry is projected to grow at 11% CAGR for next 5 years.  
  
**Premiumization trend**  
  
Segment share of entry level motorcycles have drastically reduced since FY20. Premium motorcycles and scooters are being sold more, as evident from segment share diagram.  
  
Multiple factors are pushing the personal mobility demand towards 2Ws:  
  
a. Need for affordable personal mobility  
b. Current state of road transport infrastructure  
c. Strong supply  
d. Last-mile mobility  
  
Affordable price segments dominate both scooters and motorcycles (including mopeds), with **86% and 82% of sales volumes respectively in less than Rs 1 lakh.**  


**Policies support for EV 2 wheelers**  
  
**Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes –** In 2020, the government launched PLI scheme to boost domestic manufacturing, cut down import bills, encourage exports and generate employment. These incentives are linked to incremental sales of new-age technology products manufactured domestically.  
**Automobiles and auto components sector (budget: Rs 25900cr )**- The PLI proposes financial incentives of up to 18% (sales-linked) to boost domestic manufacturing of AAT products (min. 50% domestic value addition will be required) and attract investments. This scheme will be applicable from FY 2024 for a total of five consecutive financial years.  
  
**Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery (budget: Rs18100cr) Scheme** was launched for setting up ACC Battery Storage manufacturing facilities in India, with a total manufacturing capacity of 50 Giga Watt- hour (GWh) for 5 years.  
  
**India Semiconductor Mission 2021 (budget: ₹ 76000)**, included various schemes (such as semiconductor fabrication, display fabrication, compound semiconductor & semiconductor assembly, testing, making & packaging, and design-linked incentive).  
  
**Faster Adoption and Manufacturing (of Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)**  
Subsidy phase I ( budget 900cr) was launched between FY15 and FY19 , phase II was launched between FY20 and FY24 ( Budget 10000cr)

**Points to consider**  


It is not clear due to range anxiety and safety issues, charging infra, whether 45-50% of EV 2 wheeler penetration is achievable by FY30. **Also, incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS are yet to expand EV across their entire network. Once they do, they might end up sweeping the market share from Ola Electric.**  
  
**Plus dealers of Ola electric won't survive selling only a few EVs, unit economics won' t permit that. In such a situation, network expansion, especially to Tier 2/3 cities ( where volumes are low) will be a challenge.**  
  
R&D and product development constitute 7.7% and 19.3% of revenues for FY24 and FY23 respectively.   
  
FAME II subsidies have been scaled down from 40% to 15% in Jun '23 , following which there was temporary drop in sales which recovered by festive season. In future, introducing such subsidies may play a pivotal role in EV 2wheeler sales.  
  
Ola plans to import 2 key components in cell manufacturing ( CAM and AAM) from China, which might face problems due to geopolitical issues in future.  
  
**Ola electric has 4 e-scooter models which constituted 98% of revenues in FY24, which is definitely a concentration risk.**  
  
Ola Electric is relatively new having 3 years experience in market, so they might face some issues which are unsolvable. ( provided they don't have any technology partner to guide). Plus due to lack of historic data, they may face problem of inventory management wrt variants and colours. They are trying to develop in-house cell manufacturing capabilities which, if faces issues will cause loss of product reputation in market.  
  
37% of parts are imported from suppliers outside India. Top 10 suppliers supplied 60% of parts.   
  
Employee attrition rates of 44% is too abnormal, needs to be looked into with caution.  
  
Profitability of Ola depends on availing PLI incentive schemes from GOI.  
  
Capacity utilisation of Ola electric stands at 49% in FY24, which affects its profitability and hinders from achieving economies of scale.  
  
Ola has related party transactions to the tune of 25% of revenues, one must dig deeper into those before investing.  
  
Battery cost being 30% of vehicle cost, if battery life is poor then Ola scooters will earn bad reputation in market ( full cycle of battery is yet to be seen in most vehicles).  
  
  
**Valuation**  
  
Ola electric is valued at P/S of 6.69, whereas TVS at 3.11, Eicher at 7.87, Hero at 2.79, Bajaj at 5.82. PE ratio wise TVS  74, Bajaj 34, Eicher 32, Hero 28.

**Points to consider**  
  
  
Top 5 states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telengana, Gujarat, Delhi constitute 85% of AUM, any adverse calamity in these states would negatively affect the company.  
  
Large exposure in residential and commercial real estate hence any downturn in this sector might affect Bajaj housing finance negatively.  
  
As it is non-deposit taking NBFCs, it relies on borrowings and hence any impact on interest rate might affect them negatively. 44% of borrowings are at fixed interest rates, 56% of borrowings at floating interest rates whereas 99.8% of loans advanced are in floating interest rates.  
  
Their key business strengths lie in strong parentage , diversified funding sources , vast network and risk management (one of the best HFC’s in capital & profitability ratios).  
  
Bajaj finance holds 100% of BHFL, wherein just 1 year before RHP filing they invested approx Rs 2,000 cr as an equity by acquiring 110,74,19,709 shares at Rs 18.1  
  
Average ticket size being 46 lakhs, BHFL caters to premium housing customers, which is growing at 13-15% CAGR. Also it is easy to lend being high ticket vs Affordable housing finance cos with 10 lakh ticket size.  
  
BHFL has grown at stellar speed, just in 8 years AUM of 97000cr, last 2 year AUM CAGR of 31% and PAT CAGR of 56%- all because of huge customer database of Bajaj Finance. It is said data is the most important moat for Bajaj Finance.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"SEBI NSE deal is a blatant loot of retailers NSE has proposed 1400 crore  settlement with SEBI to shut all investigations against it for richest India Inc's [ 62(?) stock brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) priority preferential colocation - private colocation = 10 lakh per rack per year,  and dark fibre connections providing early access, thus failing to provide equitable access to all its trading members thereby trying to whitewash the biggest government assisted fraud - Scam 2010 ( may be next sequel ) - in Indian history which produced unworthy billionaires at cost of gullible retailers, using one or more leased line from any of the four service providers - MTNL, TATA, Reliance and Bharti and one unauthorized Sampark Infotainment - NSE/MEM/12985 to facilitate better access to Direct Market Access (DMA) and algorithmic trading..... in 2009-10!

The scale of this settlement reveals the enormous profits generated through privileged order flow access, early order detection and front-running capabilities granted to a handful of players. Many Nifty 50 companies' liquidity appears sustained by capital accumulated through these questionable practices over the past decade, while retail investors bore the costs through [brokers](https://www.livemint.com/Money/Fb3n7pMOr0eKZOoHoaB0kK/NSE-algo-trading-case-62-broking-firms-may-had-preferential.html) that facilitated this unequal system.

With only token actions taken against CNBC/ET Now tipster Gift City based IIFL Securities' director Sanjiv Bhasin or index banks like IndusInd Bank, ICICI , RHFL etc ( a long list ) this precedent risks further entrenching the advantage of sophisticated algorithmic traders (like Jane Street's GPU-based systems), potentially eliminating any remaining non-algo participants.

Instead of permitting alleged manipulation profits to remain concentrated among privileged market players, shouldn't regulatory mechanisms be established to compensate defrauded traders? This could take the form of direct restitution or tax relief measures - rather than continuing a system that has disproportionately benefited select entities for decades.

The current settlement attempts to whitewash what may represent one of India's most significant financial scandals - one that has enriched both corporate and political interests through systematic market advantages. Now, these same patterns risk being perpetuated through new AI-driven trading systems that provide even greater opacity and deniability.

This raises fundamental questions about our judicial system's ability to address such complex financial crimes in a timely manner - whether examining the 7-year deliberation on electoral bonds, Justice Varma's proceedings, or the stalled Boeing investigations. The systemic delays and loopholes suggest institutional frameworks remain ill-equipped to confront modern financial engineering, leaving retail investors perpetually vulnerable.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Hyundai IPO: The other side Hello Everyone. I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter here about why you shouldn’t jump on the Hyundai India IPO, and while some points are valid, I want to share another side of the story. Not saying you should or shouldn't invest—**just clearing up some misconceptions and dropping some data to show you the other-side.**

**This IPO is not without problems I'm sure you must have seen problems on this sub already. THIS POST WILL LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.**

# Hyundai India's PE Ratio Vs Hyundai Korea's PE Ratio

One common gripe is Hyundai India’s PE ratio is around 25 versus Hyundai Korea’s \~5. Yeah, that's true, but it misses the bigger picture. Check out these other companies:

|Indian Company|Indian Company's PE|Foreign Company|Foreign Company's PE|Ratio between PEs|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|73|Nestle SA|19|3.84|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|63|Unilever PLC|22|2.86|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|29|Suzuki Motor Corp|9.5|2.7|
|BASF India|54.5|BASF SE|12.5|4.36|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|70|GSK plc|15|4.66|

Notice a trend? Indian subsidiaries usually trade at a premium. It’s because India’s seen as a high-growth market, and the free float (how many shares are available for trading) is typically lower, pushing up the PE.

We can do the same comparing Revenue to Market cap also.

|Indian Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|Foreign Company|Revenue (Billion USD)|Market Cap (Billion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India Ltd|2.32|28.27|Nestle SA|111.03|250.50|
|Hindustan Unilever Ltd|7.35|77.84|Unilever plc|58.20|157.06|
|Maruti Suzuki India Ltd|16.56|46.38|Suzuki Motor Corp|36.60|19.87|
|BASF India|1.72|4.28|BASF SE|70.43|44.73|
|GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited|0.4|5.4|GSK plc|39.46|79.54|
|Hyundai India|8.3|19|Hyundai Motor Co|125.35|44.86|

This data honestly surprised me too. Suzuki Motor Corp holds 58% of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. This suggests that the rest of Suzuki Motor Corp is actually negatively valued. And yes the Revenue being more than the market cap for some companies is not a mistake. This just goes to show the discrepancy between the foreign and Indian share markets.

My point here is that the Indian company will **ALWAYS** seem overvalued compared to their foreign parents. Even if you were to dig deeper like I did with the Suzuki Example, you will realise that the market cap for the foreign company seems to be disproportionately coming from the Indian company which would be listed as an Asset on their books.

# Comparing PE/Valuation with Competition

|Company|Market Cap (Cr INR)|Revenue (Cr INR)|PE Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Maruti Suzuki|3,91,000|1,46,000|29.01|
|Mahindra and Mahindra|3,78,000|1,42,000|33.56|
|Tata Motors|3,37,000|4,44,000|10.75|
|Hyundai India|1,59,258|71,302|**\~26.5**|

So, the PE ratios for Hyundai India is actually less than Maruti and Mahindra. It's market cap to revenue ratio is also lower than Maruti and Mahindra. Tata motors is the exception here since they do operate in more sectors.

Now I know that you should not judge stocks solely based on PEs, but this provides a quick overview as to where Hyundai India stands. You and dig deep through their books and you will find that everything seems to be inline with their peers.

Even their Market Cap to Revenue is inline with Maruti and Mahindra.

# Index Inclusion: Why It Matters

Hyundai India is set to be included in major stock indexes (Nifty 100, Nifty 500, Possibly Nifty Next 50) within the next 6 months. Once it’s in the indexes, lots of passive funds will automatically buy it, increasing demand and potentially driving up the price.

At IPO, Hyundai India’s market cap will be similar to big players like Punjab National Bank or Adani Energy Solutions. Even 2-3% of shares going to index funds can mean around 10% of total free float shares getting snapped up. The actively managed funds will also want to buy Hyundai India since it’s now part of their benchmark Index, boosting demand even more.

# The Offer for Sale (OFS)

I have to say that the OFS offering has lead to some South Korean hate on this sub. This is insane and should not be happening. Hyundai came into India, set up a subsidiary, manufacturing and genuine created value. And even if their actions are ""Greedy"", that is just one company. It's insane to see this hate being directed at South Korea as a whole.

So what's exactly happening: Hyundai Korea is selling shares, not Hyundai India. They **claim** to need funds for R&D which happens at the Parent company while Hyundai India is only for Manufacturing. This IPO lets them get cash without Hyundai having to take on debt or dilute its equity.

**Hyundai Korea still holds a majority after the IPO, so they’re not just exiting.** They’re still invested and running the show, ensuring that the company has the backing it needs for future growth. They very much still have skin in the game. OFS is actually not that uncommon when you look at it. The Indian company's financials are healthy and it simply doesn't need a cash injection at this point.

# The Dividend

Pre-IPO dividends can sound sketchy, but they’re actually pretty common. Look at Indigo—they did the same thing. Hyundai India is using its generated cash to pay dividends, which should be factored into your valuation calculations. This can actually boost ROE by reducing excess equity, making the company look more efficient.

NB: Came across this research which explains in more detail why Pre-IPO dividend is not as bad as you think [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927538X23002664)

# The IPO will be undersubscribed

Well- Data suggests otherwise. The IPO is already over 40% subscribed. As of writing this post, DIIs (Domestic Mutual Funds and AMCs) have still NOT placed their Bids (They usually come in on the last day). The IPO has similar subscription to Paytm (and other IPOs this size) after 2 days. Given the trends in past IPO subscriptions, it is fair to assume this IPO will be full subscribed and may be oversubscribed by up to 2x.

Even if it doesn't hit 3-4x oversubscription, filling up the subscription is still a win, especially since Hyundai is raising a massive $3.3 billion USD.

(NB: If you want to check this data for yourself, head over to: [https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active](https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=HYUNDAI&series=EQ&type=Active) then click Bid details and select ""Consolidated Bids"". Make sure you are not only looking at the NSE Bids.)

# Grey Market Premium (GMP)

Even though GMP has dropped, it never went below zero. It has always stayed a premium and never became a discount. This shows steady interest and suggests the IPO is priced fairly—not overpriced or underpriced.

Unlike many IPOs that rely on discounts to attract buyers, Hyundai’s valuation means the listing price should align closely with the offer price, reflecting true value. If you only apply to IPOs for listing gains- This isn't an IPO for you.

# A side note

One of the biggest issues with the Indian stock market is that the Breath of the market is not increasing as fast as the Depth. More and more capital is pouring in but the number of large companies isn't increasing at the same speed. Given the IPOs that have been coming out at such a huge discount recently all giving amazing listing gains, I could imagine why this is a turn off that Hyundai decided to list themselves at fair market value. But IPOs aren't meant for a listing gain. They are to take a company public, which this one seems to be successful in doing.

# --- Edit ---

**Appreciate all the feedback. Someone even texted me and called me Mr. Hyundai Man which I found hilarious. A few common points I missed seem to be brought up by multiple people, so I wanted to address these.**

# The Royalty

So, yes. There is a Royalty.

But guess what? Every foreign company with an Indian subsidiary does this. Why? Are they trying to loot India? No. This is the payment for maintaining the brand. Any spend Hyundai Korea does to polish the Hyundai brand benefits Hyundai India and this is the payment for that. The royalty is capped at 5%. This isn't anything insane and many other MNCs - including Toyota India (which is currently private), Bosch, Schaeffler India and Wabco India - pay royalty payments to their parent companies. A couple interesting ones are:

|Company|Cap on Royalty to Parent for Brand|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nestle India|4.5%|They tried to increase it recently but the shareholders rejected the resolution.|
|Maruti Suzuki|5%||

Now, the Cap doesn't always mean this much money will be payed out. In FY23, Maruti paid 3.75% royalty to Suzuki motors. At one point in time, the royalty used to be above 6-6.5% before coming down to the 5% cap now in place. So, I ask you this-

**If Maruti Suzuki has a 5% royalty, why is Hyundai India's 5% not justified? I would argue that ""Maruti"" has a brand value within India which may be sustainable without Suzuki. Hyundai is Hyundai and without the name, it has no alternative.**

Hyundai India benefits much more from this royalty deal than Maruti Suzuki does. Yet for some reason, people think Hyundai is ""Greedy"" and Suzuki are Saints.

# Mini IPO? 75% promoter shareholding rule

Someone in the comments said ""the parent company has to offload an additional 7.5% stake in the coming six months to reach the max 75% promoter holding"". This is partly true that 7.5% additional stake needs to be offloaded but not in the next 6 months. This will take place in 3-5 years ([Source](https://www.autocarpro.in/news/hyundai-india-to-dilute-75-additional-stake-in-3-5-years-122999)). This would be 1-2% additional free float every year something the markets can easily handle while increasing liquidity for the stock (speculation alert) potentially propelling Hyundai India into the F&O Category.

It is in **Hyundai's best interest to do this as slowly as possible too**. If they were to crash the price of the Indian subsidiary, Hyundai Korea's books would show fewer assets. To keep their own book inflated, they will make sure this happens responsibly. **They aren't selling and running away, they will still own 75% of the company.**

# So you are actually saying Hyundai India is a Buy?

Absolutely NOT. The purpose of this post is not to tell you to buy or not. It was to show the facts. The decision to BUY is yours. People seemed to have reached the conclusion that Hyundai is Bad with incomplete facts.

It is funny how people have a problem with things from Royalty to Valuation. Funny part is, from the looks of it, Hyundai India tried to copy Maruti Suzuki. And this makes sense!

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Rate Cuts are here : Correction Incoming  US FED cuts 50 bps and expect further 2 rate cuts this year.

Next RBI will cut rates either in October meet or December meet. 

Expectation from Fed is now to cut 75 bps or 100 bps in next 2 meetings which will push RBI into corner if they delay till December meet.

Now about the incoming correction !!

Nifty is at life highs whereas many psu, midcaps and other stocks are down by about 15-20%. This trend will continue as large caps like Hdfc bank, kotak, Bajaj twins, asian paints others which have not run in last 3 years will move to new highs breaking out of range and others will slowly slide down. 

By the time corrections start in Nifty many stocks will be around 30 - 40% down from top.

There are many reasons for a correction which our market is showing but most investors have turned blind eye towards them. Have written in comments.

Since people ask in

2000 - IT Bubble
2007 - Real Estate 
2018-20 - COVID 

this time it is coming straight from the central banks.

Policy error - 2024/25 - UJ Carry Trade round 2.0

All top 4 economies eg. China, India and Japan want a weaker currency wrt Dollar so that the exporter earns more.

But in an election year the current administration also wants to keep Dollar lower. And with rate cuts this will further push lower.

This time China, Japan and US policy with regards to inflation and then stagflation will bring the markets down.

Some Predictions :

S&P 500 and Dax both are going up by about 5 -7 % in next 2 months.

Nifty could also reach 27k on back of heavy weights with hdfc bank lifting the most. No clear pattern as of now on Nifty. 

Expect a bounce from here on in all indexes in next 2 months. 

Time to exit from the market signal is triggered. Start exiting before the paper profits go poof.

Holding Hdfc & Kotak Bank.


Updated : For Data Dependent Investors 

Points which indicate correction is around the corner.

IT sector will take a hit once the US officially declares a recession which might come around Jan - Mar 25 or its next quarter. 

Once IT goes, India's consumption story will come back to Hindu growth rate i.e. 3-4% with inflation at 2-3%. 

Nifty PE ratio is close to 30 pre adjusted to 2021 April calculation, when ever pe ratio goes above 25 it sends over heating signal of markets and markets do correct with respect to time wise and price wise.

US Fed cutting rates also signals market correction within 3 months. 

2 SME IPO amassed way too much money from markets wrt to its fundamentals. 

Sable government behaving like unstable govt like of 2009-2014 government. Markets never like this instability.

Everyone from delivery agent to maids are pumping money into stocks -- it's a signal to exit from market not to jump on this ship.

And SIP is now the holy grail and whenever we love one product or scheme it just doesn't perform the way it has done in history. Like blue chips from 2020 till today eg. Hdfc bank, kotak, asian paints etc.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Interesting charts which suggest this party is close to an end TLDR: Current Bull run party is over. Small and mid caps will be first to take a hit.

1. Simply put a Bull Run is a period of overall asset appreciation in general - Nifty 3.3x from Covid Crash bottom and 2x from top of just before covid crash. It has been only 4 years.
2. This attracts more and more people to the market.
   1. Mutual fund industry had AUM of Rs. 65 trillion in July 2024.
   2. History - 30 trillion in 2020, 20 trillion in 2017, 10 trillion in 2014.
   3. This simply indicates more and more money is being poured into the market.
   4. So much so that for the first time DIIs have become equal/crossed FIIs in value in 2024.
3. As people put away their cautiousness and become greedy they get a sense of confidence and take bets in smaller and riskier companies. This is evident as we see smallcaps rise faster than mid and large caps.
   1. Small cap index is 6x since covid bottom whereas nifty is only 3.3x.
   2. Recent popularity of SME IPOs.
4. Finally the charts. These are created by dividing Smallcap and Midcap Indexes by Nifty Index (Below are cnxsmallcap/nifty50 and cnxmidcap/nifty50 respectively)

[cnxsmallcap\/nifty50](https://preview.redd.it/vdk89sp6vmnd1.png?width=3190&format=png&auto=webp&s=101e8ecd63668d69698176dcfb66d8edeb4f9662)

You can see last peak was in 2018 and we all know that from 2018 to 2020 there was a bear run in small caps (and mid too to some extent) - I will not attach these charts. Easy to look them up.

In last 20 years these channels have never been violated, but their boundaries have been clearly respected 5-6 times at least.

So I am of the opinion that this party is over especially in small and midcaps. It may be tomorrow or 6 months from now. Since these are month level charts so can take time. But one monthly reversal candle and it will all tumble. Even if nifty rises for next few years, small and mid caps cannot outperform nifty according to these charts.

I had an experience with SBI and Groww regarding a request to release the amount held by an IPO (Reegal resources). This is not a hate post towards SBI and Groww. I am sharing this to get opinions on whether the issue is from me or their support. If it's from my side, what can I do to be clearer and express my problem to resolve these types of issues quickly.

Okay now lets get to the point, i applied for the IPO reegal resource on Aug 12 and of course didnt get the allotment :-( . Usually it will take 2-3 days for the amount to be released once the IPO registrate informs the bank to unblock the amount. But this time the amount was not credited even after 1 week, i called SBI bank customer care (Since the registrate already informed bank to release the amount). The handler informed me to send a mail to [support.upi@sbi.co.in](mailto:support.upi@sbi.co.in) along with few details. SBI replied to me in two day instructing me to raise a complaint from their CRM-CMS portal ([https://crcf.bank.sbi/](https://crcf.bank.sbi/)). In the portal it asked for few more details and one of them is ""Transaction ID/UTR number"".

I believed that a transaction ID would only be created when money is taken out or added to my account, not for an AutoPay request. And i have no idea what they meant by UTR number.

And so, i raised a ticket in groww app, since ive used the groww UPI to create the autopay (neither gpay not YONO knows about this autopay request). So i thought if there is a possibility for getting this transaction id or UTR then it will be only available in groww. Attached the convo between me and the groww support.  
  
As you can see, i tried explaining my situation and they sent a response (which seems very much like an auto generated response). I tried explaining again and even telling them to inform me if its not possible to get these details. For this, they again sent the same response (with zero changes).This was very frustrating to me, as they are totally ignoring my whole question and responding the same thing again and again. Even when asked for feedback link they keep saying the same thing and marking the ticked as resolved.

I can understand that the problem is not with groww but their response is too irritating and leaving only more questions instead of answering the current one. They just see few keywords and share a auto generated response or template response instead of actually reading/understanding the questions.

  
Please share you opinion on this and how to handle these type of support.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"KRN Heat Exchanger (Plausible explanation for the 80% stock rise) Disclaimer: I do have a vested interest in posting this, I have invested quite a bit of my portfolio in KRN, I did this when my manpower staffing company had a discussion with their MD and CHRO but do hear me out.


1. What does KRN do?
KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Limited (KRN) specializes in manufacturing fin and tube type heat exchangers for the heat ventilation air 
conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) industry and their products are primarily made from non-ferrous metals such as copper and aluminum. KRN 
customizes heat exchangers in various shapes and sizes to meet customer requirements and market demand with diameters ranging from 5 mm to 15.8 mm. 

2. Recent rise in stock price (manipulation or future expectations of strong profit growth):
KRN has given 80% returns since 1 month and has risen from 447 levels since Nov 5th and touched 800 levels yesterday.


3. A few possible reasons for this:

a. KRN is the only listed heat exchanger manufacturer and that gives investors a chance to get exposure to the HVAC & R components market

b. Q2 performance: The net profit for KRN Heat Exchanger grew 43% year on year at consolidated levels to ₹12.37 crore compared to ₹8.65 crore in the same quarter last year.

c. In their RHP for IPO they mentioned that the proceeds would fund their new manufacturing plant.
(Personal note if you choose to believe me: I work for a manpower staffing agency and we are in discussions with KRN's MD and CHRO for our support for their new plant with approx 2000+ temp and 500 perm workers.)

d. The above point suggests a strong order book that's evidenced by their client base who are mainly in the Air conditioners manufacturing industry including, including Daikin Air conditioning, Schnieder Electric IT Business India, Kirloskar Chillers, Blue Star, Climaventa Climate Technologies and Frigel Intelligent Cooling Systems India

e. In regards to the point above, temperatures around India have been rising due to various reasons with 2024 summer having recorded some serious health concerns around the country. We might be in for the same in 2025 and for the foreseeable future. 
In this case, KRN stands to benefit as demand for coolers will only grow and so will the orders from KRN's clients who are leading AC manufacturers.

f. Their products are also used as components in coolers across various industries like data centres, railways, automotive, defence, medical equipment, washing machines, and a few others. (Chemical manufacturing and oil & gas industries are the two largest consumers of heat exchangers in India, with each accounting for nearly one-fifth of total industry turnover in 2023. Other key end-use consumers are power & energy, HVAC, and metallurgy. Together, these five industries 
contributed to 80% of the heat exchanger industry revenue in 2023.)

g. They have increased their share of business from exports 10% to 15% increasing their customer range in Europe but still maintaining their current domestic order book.


4. Possible risks:

a. 75% of revenue is derived from top 10 customers which can pose a risk if some of them decide to change their component vendors

b. 80% of their raw materials are imported and any increase in tarrifs may affect financial performance 


5. Conclusion: Due to reasons mentioned above and the growth of the HVAC components industry, KRN is a strong long term investment and this might explain its meteoric stock price rise.

Disclaimer: I do have a vested interest in posting this, I have invested quite a bit of my portfolio in KRN, I did this when my company had a discussion with their MD and CHRO

That said, let me know your thoughts on KRN or if you have any questions. Will try to answer them.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"HDB Financial had price band of 700-740 which came as a shock for investors who got in at 1000-1200 in unlisted space in last few years. Now, some finfluencers are claiming same will happen in unlisted shares of NSE (and NSDL) when they go for IPO too. Can it be the case? Let us check. https://preview.redd.it/xjigmucxdt9f1.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=391d337aec5a0c8bfd8b1aeccee11b32b1d225d6

HDB Financial is one of the many NBFCs in India. Many of them are listed like Bajaj, Chola group etc. The usual P/B multiple for good companies is around 3.2 to 3.8 in a bull market. If it is great then it can go to 6.5 also and if it's average then it can be around 2.3 to 2.7 types. Now at this price it's P/B is around 3.5 and at 1300, it would go to P/B of 6.1. Now Bajaj Finance already trades around that which has far better NIM, RoA, Profit and Sales CAGR for last 7 years. So, it is ok to list around 670-850 range. If it performs well then market will re-rate it accordingly.

Now coming to NSE, there are only 2 functional exchanges in practical considerations. Very few trades on MSEI or some other exchanges specially after this discount broker boom from 2010s. So practically it is a duopoly, and new entry is very difficult due to regulations. The BSE, which has about 10% of India’s trading volumes (around 25% share in derivatives) and currently trading around 85 P/E. Whereas NSE with 90% of India’s trading volumes (75% share in derivatives) is running around 45 to 50 P/E in unlisted space. Clearly, unlike HDB financials, NSE is at a discount to it's peer. So in current market situation there is low chance of it is being listed at such lower valuations and even if it get listed at such lower valuation it will find it's fair valuation (with respect to BSE) maybe in a year.

But if we enter in a correction again or in a bear market, then it can list at lower prices or can stay there.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Tell me your best earning stocks in last one year and what was thought process while buying it? My Stock Market Experience

When I buy stocks, I first look at key metrics like market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and recent news, especially about new orders or developments related to the stock. After this analysis, I rely on my instincts to make a final decision. While I often make profits, there are times when I incur losses. However, over the last six months, my losses have outweighed my gains.

One stock where I had an interesting experience was Waaree Energies.

My Journey with Waaree Energies

I initially invested in this stock during its IPO. After receiving some shares in the IPO allotment, I bought additional shares on the listing day. I sold all my holdings at ₹2,500 a few days later. However, the stock rallied further to ₹3,800, leaving me regretting my early exit.

Later, when Donald Trump was elected as the U.S. President, the stock saw a downturn due to his policies. Trump frequently expressed his intent to impose duties on imports from China and India, impacting the renewable energy sector. I began buying the stock at ₹3,000, averaging down to ₹2,600, which brought my overall purchase price to ₹2,800. Eventually, I sold my holdings at ₹3,340, making a substantial profit.

Why I Chose Waaree Energies

I was exploring renewable energy stocks because of the increasing adoption of solar panels in households. The Indian government provides a ₹78,000 subsidy under the PM Suryaghar Yojana for installing household solar systems, which has boosted demand.

Despite some concerns over the stock’s valuation, I believed in Waaree because it has the largest solar module manufacturing capacity in India. My bet paid off.

An Important Learning

While I profited, I discovered that Waaree primarily generates revenue through exports rather than domestic household solar installations. This is because the government subsidy of ₹78,000 applies only to solar systems that comply with Domestic Content Requirements (DCR). When I explored installing a solar system for my household, I was surprised that the installer did not have Waaree panels. Despite being a market leader, Waaree did not have DCR-compliant panels in the widely preferred N-type TOPCon bifacial technology.

Currently, Waaree has introduced DCR-compliant panels but still lags in some advanced technologies. I believe the company will eventually produce the best panels in the industry. If the government relaxes DCR compliance rules, Waaree’s stock price could skyrocket.

My Current Outlook

The recent sell-off in Waaree’s stock has created another potential buying opportunity. I’m considering reinvesting in the company as I foresee strong growth in the renewable energy sector.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"$TDIC squeeze potential after $BYND # 🚀 **$TDIC Investment Thesis: Low Float, 70%+ Insider Owned, Short Squeeze Setup?** 🚀

**Dreamland Limited ($TDIC)** - Hong Kong event management company that IPO'd July 23, 2025. Traded **above $7** recently but got **hammered by shorts** to **~$0.61**. Low float + locked insider shares = **potential squeeze play**. Here's why I'm bullish:

---

## 📊 **Key Stats**
| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Insider Ownership** | **70.79-71.73%** (CEO Wai Yue Seto owns ~71.7%) |
| **Public Float** | **~8.76M shares** (out of 31M total) |
| **Short Interest** | **0.24-0.27%** (21.3K shares) |
| **Lock-up Expires** | **~Jan 19, 2026** (180 days from IPO) |
| **Recent High/Low** | **$6.75 → $0.61** |

---

## 💎 **Why Buy $TDIC Now?**

### 1️⃣ **INSIDER SKIN IN THE GAME**
- **70%+ owned by insiders** - they ain't selling anytime soon
- **Lock-up until Jan 2026** = no immediate dump risk from big holders
- Management aligned with shareholders

### 2️⃣ **LOW FLOAT = HIGH VOLATILITY**
- **8.76M float** = tiny supply for explosive moves
- Even modest buying volume can spike this hard
- **Short squeeze potential** if shorts pile in (currently low but could change)

### 3️⃣ **OVERSOLD AFTER SHORT ATTACK**
- Dropped from **$7+ to $0.61** on post-IPO selling + short pressure
- **Events industry recovering** - Hong Kong tourism booming
- Trading at **depressed levels** vs IPO valuation

### 4️⃣ **SQUEEZE CATALYSTS**
- **Low short interest** + **low float** = perfect setup
- **Upcoming earnings** could flip sentiment
- Social media buzz could ignite retail interest

---

## 🔥 **THE PLAY**
- **Entry**: ~$0.61 (current levels)
- **Target**: $3-5 short-term, $7+ if squeeze hits
- **Stop**: $0.40 (tight risk management)

**Float too small, insiders too locked, shorts too cocky.** This smells like a **classic squeeze setup**.

---

## ⚠️ **RISKS**
- **High volatility** - can drop further
- **Illiquid** - wide spreads, hard to exit
- **Events sector sensitive** to economy/regs
- **Geopolitical** Hong Kong risks

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"My Mutual Fund SIP Plan – Need Opinions from Fellow Investors Hey folks,

After a lot of research, reading on Reddit, and binge-watching YouTube videos 😅 I’ve finally shortlisted and started SIPs in the following funds:

Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund – ₹6,000

HDFC Midcap Opportunities Fund – ₹2,500

Bandhan Small Cap Fund – ₹1,500

I’m planning to scale my total SIP amount to ₹20,000/month soon, with this revised allocation:

Parag Parikh Flexi Cap – ₹6,000

HDFC Midcap Opportunities – ₹7,000

Bandhan Small Cap – ₹7,000

My goal is long-term wealth creation (10–15 years horizon), and I’m okay with taking a bit of risk since I’m investing with an aggressive mindset. I see Parag Parikh as the stabilizer in my portfolio to balance out the aggression from mid and small caps.

A bit about me:

Age: 27

Single, living with parents

I give ₹10,000/month to my mom for household expenses

I currently have an RD of ₹21,000/month, but I’m planning to reduce it to ₹10,000

Whatever remains, I usually park for IPOs with decent fundamentals (some for listing gains, some for long-term holds)

Would love to hear your thoughts on:

1. Is this ₹20,000 SIP allocation well balanced for an aggressive long-term portfolio?

2. Should I tweak the distribution a bit or add a different category (like ELSS or large cap)?

3. Any suggestions on how to handle the RD vs SIP part more efficiently?

1. Company has not gone IPO yet, but there are internal talks about the company hitting Series C funding this year and going IPO soon after.
2. Since the shares are not on public market, we need to rely on company's discretion on buying back the exercised options. (Is it possible for a private company to deny buybacks for the entirety of these 3 months?)
3. Company seems to be growing and capturing market. New domains are explored, competitions are tight and still winning, sacking customers from competitors etc. Whether the product is worth shit is a different topic, but the company seems to have huge face value.
4. The total amount I have to spend to exercise my ESOPs will be ~5L, and as per the current valuation data if I sell them back immediately I should get ~14L. (Exclusive of taxes)
5. I don't have a 5L lying around gathering dust.
6. I do have an MF portfolio of ~10L at this point (Goal is for building a retirement corpus)

Now here comes the question: What do I do?

I think my options are:-
1. Exercise and request for an immediate buyback (only if the company is willing)
2. Ignore and dump the ESOPs
3. Liquidate some of my MF portfolio and exercise and hold
4. Do some math, exercise and request for an immediate buyback of a certain number of options, and use that money to exercise and hold the remaining options

Personal biases:-
1. From how the company has been able to piss off the competitors and constantly capturing more customers and how the CEO's tongue can WALK, I think the company will grow, so would prefer to hold onto some shares.
2. Company has a very toxic work culture and employees had been leaving for a long time now (new recruits keep filling the spots), so if a day comes when the recruitment can't match with the quitting rate then I guess the company collapses?

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Should I take the plunge into my first SME stock (Fidel Softech)? Hey folks,

I’ve been investing since 2018, maintaining an XIRR of ~20 % overall. I do both short-term and long-term plays and have bagged a few multibaggers along the way.

What I haven’t done yet is invest in an SME-listed stock, mainly because of the big lot sizes and liquidity concerns.

Recently, while screening for small IT-service and AI-adjacent companies, I stumbled upon Fidel Softech Ltd (FIDEL) a niche LangTech company doing AI-enabled localization, translation, and multilingual IT services with clients across Japan, the US, and India.

On paper, it looks solid:

FY25 revenue up ~37 %, PAT up ~54 %

Debt-free, ~17 % net margins, dividend paying

Expanding in the US (Austin office) and Japan (subsidiary acquisition)

Clear growth roadmap — aiming for ₹100 cr revenue by FY27 and “5× in 5 years” from IPO

I honestly don’t see any glaring negatives apart from the usual small-cap/SME risks (low liquidity, high lot size, client concentration, execution).

Before I invest, I’d love to hear from anyone who’s:

already invested in FIDEL,

closely tracking the company, or

aware of any red flags beyond the typical small-company issues.

Would you consider it worth entering at current levels, or should I wait for main-board migration/liquidity improvement first?

Curious to get some crowd wisdom on this one.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Ather IPO is fully SUBSCRIBED! It's like a half-baked factory wants a full-course ₹2,626 Crore funding meal! Here's my take 👇🏻 About Ather: They design their own products like motors, chassis, controllers, chargers, and so on. But outsource manufacturing. Ather has a shiny factory in Hosur (4.2L units/year) and is dreaming of Factory 3.0 to hit 14.2L capacity, but is currently using only 41% of what it already has!

Big Question: Why expand when you're not even close to full capacity?

Ather's ""ask""

1. IPO Price: ₹304–321
2. Fresh issue: ₹2,626 Crore
3. Market Cap post-IPO: ₹11,954 Crore

But here’s the thing, this capex plan? It makes no sense! Why? Well, the financials say LOSSES!

1. Negative cash flow? Yup.
2. Profits? Nowhere in sight. Needs to raise cash again and again, like that friend who always forgets their wallet.

Next comes competition? Ruthless.

TVS and Bajaj aren’t just older, they’re richer, profitable, and out for blood.  
Ather might have started the EV party, but now it’s struggling to stay on the guest list.

That's a lot of baggage, though, but let’s say:

India sells 1.56 Crore EV 2Ws and Ather gets 10% market share = \~12-13L units/year. That’s ₹25-30,000 Crore in sales, and finally, profits + cash flows? But that’s a big “if”. Bajaj & TVS are already saying, “Not so fast.”

Ather looks great on paper and says all the right thing. But is still figuring itself out.

Swipe right only if you're patient, and you might as well be buying hope and not numbers!  
Otherwise, it might be safer just to watch this one from the sidelines.",1746018791.0,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1kbg5u9/ather_ipo_is_fully_subscribed_its_like_a/
Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"NSDL: What's the plan for long-term? 1. Zero debt.

2. NSDL is a key player in India's financial infrastructure, serving as the country's first and largest depository. It plays a critical role in the digitization of securities, enabling paperless stockholding for investors.

3. While its competitor, CDSL, has a dominant share in retail demat accounts, NSDL holds the lion's share of assets under custody by value, with a strong client base of institutions, high-net-worth individuals, and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). This provides NSDL with a stable and predictable revenue stream, as a significant portion of its income comes from recurring fees.

4. NSDL's business extends beyond its core depository services. It also has a payments bank (NSDL Payments Bank Ltd) and a database management arm (NSDL Database Management Ltd), which offer services like KYC verification and the National Skills Registry. This diversification, while currently a small contributor to profits, offers long-term growth potential in the digital financial services and e-governance space.

5. The growth of India's capital markets, along with increasing retail investor participation and the government's push for digital financial services, provides a strong tailwind for NSDL's business.

Risks:

1. While NSDL's revenue is largely recurring, it is still exposed to market fluctuations. A slowdown in the securities market or reduced trading volumes could impact its transaction-based fees.

2. As a market infrastructure institution, NSDL operates under strict regulations. Any changes in regulations or non-compliance could pose a risk.

3. Following its IPO, NSDL's stock experienced a significant rally. Investors should carefully evaluate the stock's valuation to ensure it aligns with their investment strategy.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Why Are FIIs Selling Indian Stocks? Data-Driven Insights & When It Might End Let me share some key facts first:

* India’s total market cap is ₹421 lakh crore.
* FIIs currently hold around ₹69 lakh crore, which accounts for approximately 16% of the market.
* DIIs also hold 16%, and individual investors are nearing 10%.

[Secondary Market Provisional Data](https://preview.redd.it/yu5t54fwdcde1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea07bbaeccd2956f23a2ef0e2cb3571fd277db9a)

Back in 2015, FIIs held around 21%, while DIIs only had 10%. I see this shift as a positive one—it gives more power to domestic investors. However, this doesn’t mean FIIs should just leave the market. They’re still vital, and they’re not going anywhere.

In the last 3-4 months, FIIs have sold about ₹2 lakh crore in the secondary market. But if you look at the entire year, their IPO market purchases have balanced out the selling. In fact, their net selling for the whole year was just ₹7,000 crore, and their overall holdings have increased.

So, despite the recent selling, I believe FIIs will continue investing in India in the long run—provided the government policies remain stable. Taxes are a concern, but we’ll see how that plays out.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"[IPO Analysis] EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd. Hey folks,

I started [helloquant ](https://helloquant.in)as a side project. Will talk about it later in details. One thing I realized is for IPO, there is no good website which is clean and give analysis in a straight forward manner. So, we are starting an IPO Analysis Series where we look at upcoming Indian IPOs through a **quantitative lens** — no fluff, just data, valuations, risks, and context.

Our first breakdown is on **EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd.** (incorp 1999), a company in the business of pre-engineered steel buildings and prefabricated structures. They also manufacture EPS (thermocol) blocks, sheets, and packaging products.

# 📌 IPO Details

* **Price Band**: ₹194–204
* **Issue Size**: ₹504 Cr (Fresh ₹300 Cr + OFS ₹204 Cr)
* **Current GMP**: \~₹20
* **Use of Proceeds**: Capex, working capital, debt repayment

# 📊 Financial Highlights

* Revenue CAGR: **31.4%** (highest among peers)
* PAT growth: **57%**
* ROE: **22.69%** | ROCE: **22.88%**
* EBITDA Margin: **10%+**

# 🔎 Valuation vs Peers

Peers: PENIND, INTERARCH, EVERESTIND, BEARDSELL

* **P/E** = 34.54 (rich vs peers)
* **ROE** = 22.7% (highest among peers)
* **WC Days** = 35 (very efficient)

# 🧮 Strengths

* Strong presence in a growing prefab construction market
* Diversified product mix (buildings + EPS)
* Expanding capacity with IPO proceeds
* Fastest revenue growth among peers

# ⚓ Anchors & Analyst Views

* Anchor investors include **WhiteOak, 360One, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley**
* Positive recommendations from **Reliance Securities, SBI Securities**

# ⚠️ Risks

* Volatility in raw material prices (steel dependency)
* Execution risks in expansion
* Competition from larger, established players

# 💡 Our Take

At the upper band, valuations look **expensive on P/E basis**, but strong ROE, efficient working capital, and anchor participation show confidence. Might be interesting for listing gains, but medium/long-term depends on execution.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"One Up On Wall Street - Part 1 Hi everyone,

I have been posting the summary of **One up on wall street** based on the set of books recommended in this [List](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaGrowthStocks/comments/1htigh6/10_mustread_books_for_investors/?share_id=WmXLPNoBwyvmqrzZzZ8gj&utm_name=ioscss). Starting with the summary of the introduction chapter from the one up on wall street. You can follow the continuation post from these links below.

The points here will be my interpretation of the book rather than what Peter Lynch is trying to teach, so follow it up with your own reading.

TLDR:

**If you have decided to pick stocks on your own then**

1. The **most useless information** about a stock is it's **price**
2. **Stop listening** to the **noise** including the so called professional Investors
3. Observe your surroundings the **best stock**s are always **around you** (liking)
4. Liking a company is not good enough reason to buy the stock, you need to do **your** **own research**(which is what he will be teaching in this book)
5. Even if the company is good never **overpay**
6. Have patience bulls and bears are not **everlasting**

The goal of this book according to **Peter Lynch** is Any Normal person (I am not sure about abnormal people, he didn't mention it in the book. if you are a weirdo then you are on your own i guess) can pick a stock better than a fund manager just by observing your surroundings. you don't have to listen to news, check fancy websites just observe what people are doing, where people are buying and so on.

He promises to teach us the readers(Normal persons) how to do that by pointing us towards few fundamentals like

1. Which numbers really count when we are looking at a stock and what do they mean
2. Guidelines for how to pick cyclical, turnaround and fast growing companies

To set a little bit of context here, This version of the book that all of us will find in bookshelves is the millennium edition that was updated and release in April 2000, right around the time of Dotcom bubble burst. So he talks a little about the Dotcom IPO frenzy without knowing the market is going to crash when the book hits the shelves (We can replace dotcom with AI for current period).

Initial conversation is about how neither bear market nor the bull market last forever and that patience is required in the stock market, people with patience will be rewarded in the end. Then the IPO's of the dotocm companies where the valuation were so high that many millionaires are forming in the valley right after their IPO without having to prove themselves, he cautions people who felt missed out on these IPOs that they are lucky since the prices were so high that only a few would have benefited since everyone else is paying so much with so little earning to show for it(**Never pay High**). One reason why these stocks were risky is that you cannot measure their P/E ratio since they didn't have the important component of the P/E called E, earnings which companies are supposed to have.

Peter tells despite all this drama surrounding him, he still invested only based on ancient fundamentals. It goes like this

* Company enters a market
* It earns money
* Then stock price increases
* Or a flawed company turns itself around

**The stock Price** is the most useless information you can find about a company. What the market pays for a stock this week or next week does not tell whether the company will succeed in 3 or 4 years down the line. If you have to follow any data about the company follow one useful information which is the **earnings** assuming if the company has any.

New Industries form in every time period, but only a handful of companies survive and Only very few become the top ones. you can't just pick a stock because the field is exciting, you need find a good company, even if a company is great you should never overpay.

He provides the example **Electronic Data Systems** whose P/E was 500 at the time which he notes would take five centuries to make your investments. This is nothing but people buying on the basis of Hope than fundamentals, to avoid this he provides three ideas.

I will be modifying the examples for our time rather than the dotcom period

1. Sell shovels and Pick when there is a gold rush
   * Rather than betting on which AI company will make or break just invest in the companies that makes the stuff required for the AI. (Chips, Data center, power supply, fiber optics and so on)
2. Invest in an old company that is starting a new vertical
   * Microsoft will survive on other verticals even if their investment in Chatgpt fails, same way they survived the smart phone fuck up. This give at least protection of capital for you.(Stock market doesn't guarantee anything other than ""you will lose your money for sure"" but possible)
3. Invest in Company that leverages AI to improve their business
   * Any company that uses the new technology to improve efficiency and profit in their existing business models  (Currently everyone is slapping AI on their products)

To find these companies one doesn't have to do any research, Just observing your workplace, home, surroundings, restaurants and so on.

To give an example from our current time, I went to **Zudio** casually one day just to stroll around, only to see a sea of people standing in line to bill at least 5 items each, then I went to upper floor to see huge crowd still shopping and trying out clothes with at least 5 items in hand(almost closing time). I though this is such a good business and they must be making a lot of profits. I came home to check if they are listed in the market to find Trent valued at 4.5K per share. Unfortunately for me I did not start investing years before when it was available at 200 a piece.

Just because you like a product they sell doesn't mean you should buy it, one ought keep a list of stocks they like then do the fundamentals analysis before buying it. The important things to notice are the company's

1. Future earning prospects
2. Competitive position (Moat)
3. Expansion plans

If it's a retail company like **Zudio** you need to figure out if it's nearing the end of expansion phase, which peter terms as late innings. since earnings will not grow multi fold as it did during the early expansion phase.

**Conclusion:** When i started this post, I though I would be summarizing what I read, but I may have over estimated my talent to summarize stuff and ended up writing another book about a book i read. Similar to those annoying videos on YouTube that summarizes movies. Provide me feedback whether this is helpful or not, feel free to ask Chatgpt to summarize my summary.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Long term conviction/thesis for my stock picks All my holdings are LONG TERM only. I started serious direct stock investing from around March this year (so my returns look decent because of the run up since then). It represents 1/3rd of my total portfolio (1/3rd in MFs and 1/3rd in US equity). My goal is simple:- to buy and hold cash flow compounding machines for a long time.

Apar Industries - it was trading at a 52 week low and they were making high quality export level products. Now facing uncertainities due to tariffs.

Nuvama Wealth - major player in a fast growing sector of wealth management. Growing top line consistently at ~20% comprising mostly sticky recurring revenue. All this available at a PE of 24 and PEG < 1. Still a good buy imp, but a lot of competition in this sector.

Swiggy - I foolishly thought having everything in one platform might make customer acquisition cheaper and easier. But they are being out-executed by Zomato in every turn. I still believe this stock has more upside but not adding more.

PFC - Consistent compounder trading just about book value. Lending majorly to discoms so NPA isn't too high and growing revenue around 20%. Looking to add more as I see more growth due government push for capex and RBI's liquidity norms. I also see long term secular tailwinds for India's energy sector. (Plus div yield of 4%)

KPI Green - Growing top line at >50% and bottom line at 100% with PE of 30 in a sector with a lot of tailwinds such as renewables. No idea why this stock is so cheap. Looking to add more.

CAMS - a bet on increasing financialization of India and growth of SIPs in India. Trying toadd more toll gate businesses like this in my portfolio. Strong moat, dominant position in a duopoly with high switching costs. But growth is slowing and is not enough to sustain its current valuation.

CARE Ratings - again a low capex, high margin toll gate business with high barriers to entry. Credit rating agencies globally are considered one of the best businesses to own and always trade at a premium. Care Ratings is the fastest growing and cheapest rating agency in India so it was a no brainer. It is also backed by super investor Guy Spier.

PVR Inox - it is a turn around between. I believe movies are an integral part of India's growing out culture. And PVR Inox is a virtual monopoly in this space. But it is still a risky bet with a shaky balance sheet and shite quality of Indian movies today.

Coal India - monopoly in the coal space and available at a stupidly cheap valuation. High dividend yield. But margins depend on global coal prices.

Pricol - a monopoly in the instrument cluster space for two wheelers. I believe betting on two wheelers is safer than the auto space in India. Pricol is growing at almost 20% and I may add more if valuation stays or dips slightly.

Canara bank - trading below book value with decent growth in NII, low NPAs and high dividend yield. Looking to add more.

Stocks I am looking to add more in - KPI Green, Canara bank, Nuvama, Care Ratings, PFC.

Stocks I may exit after a year - Apar, Swiggy, Nestle, KEI.

Current Watchlist - NSDL (if it gets to IPO price), TD power systems (if it gets to 350-400 levels and tarrif concers are allayed), MCX (waiting for a dip), Adani Ports (due to the monopoly nature), Narayana Hrudalaya, Dr Agarwal's Healthcare.",1755929554.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxtsft

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"KRN Heat Exchanger IPO: A long-term play on the domestic growth story - a moneycontrol pro article. # The money raised through the fresh issue will be deployed to set up a greenfield facility

KRN is benefiting from the strong domestic demand

**Highlights** 

* Leading player in the domestic heat exchanger market
* Focus on customers and reliability help in securing premium clients
* Fresh issue (IPO Money) to provide capital and fuel growth
* Huge capacity expansion to support growth in the coming years

From a seasoned engineer — heading the operations at Lloyd Electric — to an entrepreneur, Santosh Kumar Yadav, has come a long way.

Sniffing an entrepreneurial opportunity in 2017, Yadav leveraged his extensive experience in the heat exchanger market to establish KRN Heat Exchanger with modest initial investment and operating capacity. Now he is ready to tap the capital market. KRN is a leading provider of commercial cooling products, which account for 98 percent of its revenue. The company serves industry giants such as Daikin, Blue Star, Voltas, and Carrier Aircon.

**About the business**

Based at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, KRN Heat Exchanger is a leading manufacturer of fin and tube-type heat exchangers. Specialising in HVAC&R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration) applications, KRN offers a wide range of copper and aluminium products, including condenser coils, evaporator units, and fluid coils, to meet diverse market needs.

The company has quickly developed strong technical capabilities and strong competitive advantage with a customer-centric focus. In this segment, the company is now the largest player in India along with exposure to international markets.

Its products and services are in huge demand. In the last five years, it had to expand manufacturing capacities and capabilities several times to meet demand. This time, it intends to play big and add significant capacities (6 times in comparison to present capacities), which will take care of growth over the next 3-4 years.  
KRN Heat Exchanger

Through the IPO, which is an entirely fresh issue of shares (raising Rs 342 crore), the company intends to deploy money in a new greenfield facility, having a total capex requirement of about Rs 280 crore. This facility is being developed keeping in mind the requirements of the exports market and emerging new technologies, providing huge scale and competitive advantage.

Having proven its capabilities in the domestic market, the company feels it has huge opportunities in export markets. KRN’s exports have grown from Rs 15 crore in fiscal 2022 to Rs 45 crore in fiscal 2024. They are expected to reach around Rs 80 crore in the current fiscal.

**Balance Sheet**

https://preview.redd.it/5xfsscg5uwqd1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=241fee132b32d96b318c1bfecfc9c15c631e4cc3

**Valuation**

Since the entire proceeds from the IPO will be used to develop new capacities, we value the business based on the core earnings. At the upper price band of Rs 220, the company is looking for a market capitalisation of Rs 1367 crore. However, if we take away the IPO money, cash in the books, and the capital work in progress or the money being deployed in the under-construction facility, it is valued at around Rs 1000 crore which is about 25 times its fiscal 2024 profits — quite reasonable in the light of growth and quality of the business.



# After Analysing RHP of KRN IPO(chatgpt) - OUTLOOK AND RISKS. 

**The company outlook:**

The business outlook for KRN Heat Exchanger and Refrigeration Limited, as detailed in their RHP, is positive but relies heavily on the HVAC industry and key customers. 

**Expansion Strategy:**

The company plans to expand its customer base, reducing dependence on its top 10 clients, who account for over 70% of revenue. It has already entered markets across 17 states in India and exports to 9 countries .

The company aims to increase its presence in markets like North America and Europe, as well as solidify its position in the Indian HVAC market .

**Innovation & Cost Efficiency:**

The company benefits from in-house manufacturing processes that allow better quality control and cost advantages compared to competitors who rely on external job work .

By keeping the entire product design, testing, and manufacturing under one roof, they are well-positioned to meet growing demand in a cost-effective manner .

**HVAC Industry Growth:**

The company is highly dependent on the HVAC industry, which is experiencing growth due to the increasing demand for energy-efficient and climate-control systems . However, any downturn in this industry or shifts in technology could adversely affect the company’s future growth .

Overall, the company is positioned for growth, with its strong foothold in the HVAC sector and plans for geographical expansion. However, challenges remain with reliance on key customers and market conditions in the HVAC industry.

  
**The Risk Factors:**

**Revenue Dependency on Key Customers:** 

A significant portion of the company's revenue (approximately 72.31% in FY 2024) comes from its top 10 customers, including Daikin Airconditioning India Private Limited, which alone contributed about 33.34% of revenue. A cancellation or reduction in orders from any of these customers could negatively affect the company​

**Lack of Long-term Contracts with Customers:** 

The company does not have long-term agreements with its customers. If customers decide to switch suppliers or decrease their orders, the company’s financial stability could be compromised​.

**HVAC Industry Dependency:** 

The company's revenue is heavily dependent on the HVAC industry. Any downturn in this industry, whether due to economic conditions, technological changes, or environmental concerns, could adversely affect the company’s growth and profitability​.

**Potential for Production Disruptions:**

The company relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials, and any delay or disruption in the supply chain could negatively impact operations​.

**Lack of Technical Support Agreements :** 

The company does not have formal technical support service agreements in place for machinery maintenance, which could lead to operational disruptions in case of technical breakdowns​.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Should you subscribe to the Anlon Healthcare IPO? RISKS explained!!! Anlon Healthcare, operational since 2017, specializes in manufacturing high-purity pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs. The company operates from a single WHO-GMP and ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Rajkot, Gujarat, with a current production capacity of 400 MTPA, utilized at 84% in FY25. The company's product portfolio has 65 commercialized products, with an additional 28 products in the pilot stage and 49 products under laboratory testing. Notably, Anlon is among the few Indian manufacturers of Loxoprofen Sodium Dihydrate, a specialized API used for pain management in conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and post-surgical recovery.

There are four segments: APIs (40.27% of revenue), Finished Dosage Formulations (53.12%), Nutraceuticals (6.61%), and other segments (0.01%). 

Let's understand the **IPO structure**

The IPO comprises entirely a fresh issue of 1.33 crore equity shares priced between ₹86-91 per share, with a face value of ₹10. The lot size is fixed at 164 shares. 

Now, I will talk about its **financial performance**



||
||
|**Metric** (₹ Crores)|**FY23**|**FY24**|**FY25**|
|Revenue|112.9|66.69|120.46|
|EBITDA|N/A|15.57 |32.38 |
|Net Profit|5.82|9.66|20.52 |



The P/E multiple of 14.3x positions Anlon at a significant discount to peers like AMI Organics (58.5x) and Supriya Lifesciences (29.3x). 

The company has outlined an ambitious expansion strategy centered on capacity enhancement and market diversification. Plans include establishing a new 700 MTPA manufacturing facility within 400 meters of the existing plant, which would increase total capacity to 1,100 MTPA.

**Use of IPO Proceeds** (₹121.03 crores):

1. Capital Expenditure: ₹30.72 crores (25.4%) for facility expansion
2. Working Capital: ₹43.15 crores (35.7%) for operational scaling
3. Debt Repayment: ₹5.00 crores (4.1%) for financial optimization
4. General Corporate Purposes: ₹42.16 crores (34.8%)

The company has filed 21 DMFs across regulated markets including the EU, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Jordan, and Pakistan. Approvals have been secured from ANVISA (Brazil), NMPA (China), and PMDA (Japan) for key products.

**But** Anlon Healthcare faces multiple high-impact risks that potential investors must carefully evaluate.

1. The company's entire manufacturing operation is concentrated in one facility in Rajkot, Gujarat. Any disruption from regulatory issues, natural disasters, or equipment failures could severely impact operations.
2. Approximately 77% of revenue comes from the top 10 customer. Loss of any major customer could significantly impact financial performance.
3.  Despite international regulatory approvals, exports constitute only 3% of total revenue.
4. The company's revenue pattern shows extreme fluctuations, dropping 40.9% in FY24 before surging 80.6% in FY25. So, there are questions about business predictability and sustainability.
5. Top 10 suppliers account for 90% of raw material procurement, creating supply chain vulnerability and potential margin pressure.
6. The API sector faces intense competition from Chinese manufacturers who benefit from cost advantages and scale. China controls approximately two-thirds of India's API imports, creating pricing pressure.
7. The chemical manufacturing sector faces increasing environmental regulations, with potential for production shutdowns due to compliance issues.

The Indian API market presents a robust growth opportunity, valued at $14.18 billion in 2025 and expected to reach $21.46 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 8.54%. India contributes 8.8% of global API production and benefits from the China+1 diversification strategy as global pharmaceutical companies seek alternative suppliers.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"My Perspective on NSE Pre-IPO Investment: A Long-Term Wealth Opportunity   
The upcoming IPO of NSE, accessible via the unlisted market, presents what I believe to be an exceptional long-term investment opportunity. After thorough research and analysis, I consider NSE to be a ""no-brainer"" due to the following attributes that highlight its immense potential:

---

Key Merits of NSE Stock

1. Monopoly in a Growing Market:
   - NSE is essentially a monopoly in India, a country with over 130 crore people. Its scale dwarfs exchanges across 10 countries combined.
   - With a booming retail investor base, NSE captures the majority of stock market revenues in India. Notably, demat accounts have grown from 4 crore to 8-10 crore in just 2-3 years, with the potential for further exponential growth.

2. Fintech Powerhouse:
   - Established in 1993, NSE is arguably one of the most profitable and mature fintech companies globally. While the fintech space has gained popularity in the last 5-10 years, NSE has been consistently delivering growth for nearly three decades.

3. Diverse and Stable Revenue Streams:
   - NSE benefits from various sources of revenue, including listing fees, transaction charges, clearing services, IT services, treasury income, and depository services. These revenue streams have made it a consistently profitable business for over 30 years.
   - Moreover, NSE controls highly profitable subsidiaries, further diversifying its income sources.

4. Incredible Profit Margins and Cash Reserves:
   - With a net profit margin of around 52%, NSE operates at an extraordinary level of profitability compared to other companies, which typically achieve 15-20% margins.
   - NSE also boasts over ₹12,000 crores in cash reserves, demonstrating its financial strength.

5. Strong Growth in Indian Markets:
   - India has one of the lowest retail participation rates (around 4%) compared to countries like the US (over 60%). Even a modest increase in this percentage would translate into substantial gains for NSE.
   - Given the rising number of retail investors and an expanding middle class, the next decade is expected to be a golden period for equity markets, where NSE will remain the primary beneficiary.

6. Dividend Payouts and Shareholder Returns:
   - NSE has rewarded its shareholders with rising dividends, including a recent payout of ₹90 per share. This consistent dividend policy highlights the company's commitment to returning capital to investors.

7. Historical Parallels to Wealth Creation:
   - If we look at past performance of blue-chip stocks like Infosys, Bajaj Finance, and Asian Paints, the returns over the last three decades have been staggering. NSE, with its monopolistic advantage and profitability, has the potential to deliver similar long-term wealth creation.

8. Limited Competition:
   - Even if a new stock exchange emerges, it would take at least a decade to compete with NSE’s infrastructure, brand, and market dominance. Hence, competition poses minimal risk.

9. Valuation Potential:
   - With an EPS of ₹207 and a conservative PE ratio of 50, NSE's current estimated price is around ₹10,350. However, as a monopoly, its PE could justifiably be 60-70, making the stock's growth potential even more significant.
   - BSE, which holds just 4% market share, commands a PE of 77.5, while MCX trades at a PE of 165. Given NSE's dominant position, it is undervalued relative to these smaller competitors.

10. Growth Projections:
    - NSE’s profit has grown at a stunning 35% CAGR over the past five years. Even if we project a conservative 25% growth rate, EPS could reach ₹600 within five years.
    - Applying a PE of 50 to this future EPS gives a price target of ₹30,000+ per share by 2028, and this does not factor in a potential bull rally, which could drive valuations even higher.

---

 Risk Considerations and Disclosures:

While I am optimistic about NSE’s long-term prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with investing in unlisted shares:

- Liquidity Risk:Unlisted shares are inherently illiquid compared to listed equities. It may be difficult to sell NSE shares quickly before they list on the stock exchange.

- Valuation Risk: Pricing in the unlisted market can be volatile and may not always reflect the company's true value, especially in a pre-IPO scenario.

- Regulatory Risk:NSE, like any financial institution, is subject to regulatory oversight, and changes in regulatory frameworks could impact its business model.

- Market Sentiment: NSE’s performance may be affected by macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical factors. A downturn in the broader market could impact its valuation and performance.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"SEBI has proposed some changes to the structure of large IPOs Here are some of the proposals:

1. As the average IPO sizes have been increasing, direct retail participation has remained flat over the past three years. For large public issues, retail subscription levels have been particularly muted.
2. SEBI proposed that for IPOs exceeding 50 billion rupees ($571 million), the retail investor allocation may be reduced to 25% from the current 35%, while the allocation for institutional buyers may be increased from 50% to 60% in a graded manner.
3. It also proposed increasing the number of permissible anchor investor allottees for allocations above 2.5 billion rupees.
4. It suggested including insurance companies and pension funds in the reserved category of the anchor investor portion, alongside mutual funds.
5. It proposed raising the reservation for life insurers, pension funds, and domestic mutual funds from 30% to 40% of the anchor investor portion, of which one-third would remain reserved for domestic mutual funds, while 7% would be set aside for insurance companies and pension funds.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Why Hasn't Tracxn Become a Penny Stock Yet? 
As a former employee of Tracxn, I've witnessed firsthand the company's operations and have been perplexed by its current market valuation. Tracxn's primary business model revolves around collecting and presenting data that's already publicly available. During my tenure, the company hired large teams to manually input this data—essentially, an advanced form of data scraping.

With the rapid advancements in generative AI, the landscape of data aggregation and analysis is undergoing a significant transformation. AI-driven platforms can now process vast amounts of information in real-time, offering insights that previously required extensive manual labor. This technological shift raises a critical question: why would anyone continue to pay for services like Tracxn's when AI can deliver more efficient and cost-effective solutions?

Since its IPO in October 2022 at ₹80 per share, Tracxn's stock has experienced a notable decline. As of March 13, 2025, the share price stands at ₹50.11, marking a decrease of approximately 37% from its launch price.  This downward trend prompts concerns about the company's future trajectory. If this pattern continues, it's plausible to question how much longer it will take before the stock declines by 90% or more.

In an era where AI is revolutionizing data analytics, companies that rely on manual data collection methods may find it challenging to maintain their market position. The efficiency and scalability of AI-driven solutions present a formidable challenge to traditional models, and it's imperative for such companies to innovate or risk obsolescence.

For the unaware: the company is HDFC Bank’s NBFC arm. It is India’s 4th largest retail-focused NBFC with Assets under Management (AUM) of Rs 1.07 lakh cr. It operates across three main verticals; MSMEs (39%) asset finance (\~38%) and consumer finance (\~23%). But its secret sauce is its rural customer base. Over 70% of its 1,771 branches are located in Tier-4 or smaller towns, with its average ticket size at Rs 1.65 lakh. Despite the riskier clientele, its asset quality is only slightly higher compared to peers. FYI - the IPO is mostly an Offer for Sale, with the fresh issue of Rs 2,500 cr. The money raised will be used to boost its capital base for regulatory requirements.

**FY25 Snapshot:**

* Net Interest Income: Rs 7,446 cr; +18% YoY
* PAT: Rs 2,176 cr; -12% YoY
* Gross NPA: 2.3% vs 1.9% YoY
* Net NPA: 1% vs 0.6% YoY

Big Picture: There’s a lot of buzz around 2025’s biggest IPO so far. But it’s tough to figure HDB Financial out. It isn’t a specialist like Shriram Finance or Muthoot. It also is a lot smaller than THE diversified giant Bajaj Finance. The key, experts say, is its pipeline to the mostly untapped rural India is why its loan book grew at a CAGR of 23% over FY23-25.

FWIW -  its proposed valuation is a LOT lower than Bajaj Finance and current grey market data suggests it may list at +11% pop. But Bajaj demands a premium for a reason. Does HDB deserve one because of its parent and will it match Bajaj eventually? We’ll have to see.

Founded in 1988, the company is part of the Kalpataru Group and is a Mumbai-based real estate developer with a presence in all micromarkets from mid-income to ultra-luxury. It’s the 5th largest player in the Mumbai area and as of December 2024, has completed around 120 projects. Its current pipeline includes 31 ongoing and future projects to be launched by FY27. Fun fact: its multi-segment strategy has helped pre-sales soar from Rs 3,201 cr to a reported Rs 4,800 cr in FY25; a +50% jump! That said, the company has reported losses from FY21-FY24 mostly due to high interest payments.

FYI - the IPO is 100% a fresh issue, which is a big positive. The money raised will be used to repay debt and as capex for the redevelopment biz.

**9MFY25 Snapshot:**

* Revenue: Rs 1,625 cr
* EBITDA: Rs 102 cr
* Margin: 6.2%
* PAT: Rs 9 cr

Big Picture: While the numbers aren’t out yet, it looks like FY25 will be its first year of full profitability, which is great news! While the luxury market has cooled off in 2025, over 70% of  Kalpataru’s is in the sub Rs 3-cr segment which has been doing well. Key positive triggers include how its redevelopment foray works out. Kalpataru is spending Rs 400 cr to get into the business, with one of its upcoming projects located in Chembur. PS - the IPO pricing is on the slightly expensive side and current grey market data suggests it may have very low/no listing gains. So if you’re looking to get in, strap in for the long ride!

IGI is the second largest diamond certifying body after GIA, who created the modern grading of Diamonds (i.e. - 4C’s - Colour, Cut, Carat and Clarity). GIA on the other hand has over ~50% global market share with a substantial market share in USA.

IGI has the first mover advantage in grading Lab-grown Diamonds (LGD’s) where they have 65% market share.

IGI -

IGI has 3 entities - India, Belgium and Netherlands. Belgium and Netherlands entities were acquired post IPO for a consideration of ~155 million USD (~1300 crores).

India is the largest entity contributing over 80% of revenues and 95% of EBITDA in CY24, whereas Belgium and Netherlands have a smaller contribution.

98% of revenues comes from certifications and accreditions whereas 2 percent comes from training and education.

Certifications costs at 3-5 percent at wholesale level. Broadly certification cost are at 1000 rupee per report.

IGI’s unique proposition and asset light model results in over 73% EBITDA Margins and ~100% ROCE, amongst the top 1% company in India and globally in terms of margins and capital allocation.

IGI India -

IGI India caters to Top 9/10 jewelry chains in India ( except Tanishq which does in-house)

IGI certifies Natural Diamond, Lab Grown Diamonds, Jewelry and colored stones.



Margins for the company across segments are LGD > Natural Diamonds > Jewelry and Colored Stones

Margin profile in Domestic is at 72-73% EBITDA margins.

IGI overseas operations -

IGI has 2 subsidiaries - Belgium and Netherlands.

Belgium entities overseas Belgium and USA whereas Netherlands entity overseas Netherlands, China, Hong-Kong, Middle-East and other countries.

Currently, the overseas entities operate at a sub-optimal level resulting in operating margins at ~10% v/s India margins at 72-73% EBITDA margins.



Growth Indicators -

Growth in Lab-grown Diamonds -

From CY21-24, IGI grew on back of strong LGD growth at 30% CAGR in volumes and 29% / 34% / 37% in Revenue / EBITDA / PAT.

In-terms of diamond production 18% of total diamonds produced are now Lab-grown v/s 9% in 2019.

Lab-grown Diamonds boom has been led by limited product differentiation, product affordability and newer generations adoption.

The entire longer term thesis for IGI can be on the back of what thesis you subscribe to -

LGD continuing to replace Diamond market

Price Erosion in LGD making it a differentiated market v/s LGD.

Natural Diamonds losing their shine ?

Diamonds were meant to be forever, but with the exodus of LGD and affordable jewelry, will LGD replace and destroy diamonds forever or will the mighty old diamond make a comeback?

Natural Diamond Industry declined by 2.4 billion USD (~8% in CY23) with 50% decline led by wider adoption of LGD’s.



Natural Diamonds have also lost their ability as store of value with prices down ~40% from peak.



According to De Beers, among the world’s largest natural diamond company, the below chart shows supply coming down materially as natural diamond miners continue to try and artificially inflate prices below.



Lab-grown Diamonds have replaced a part of Natural Diamonds due to better affordability but lab grown diamonds pricing has seen a steep decline with a price correction of over 60% in CY24.



The steep decline in LGD poses challenges to IGI’s certification pricing and further declines in LGD prices cannot be ruled out owing to better manufacturing capabilities driving down prices further.

IGI had to drop prices in April-May of it’s certifications because of drop in LGD prices resulting in volume-pricing impact which is expected to continue for next 2 quarters.

While pricing has remained relatively stable over the last 9-10 months, any further sharp pricing decline can de-rail IGI’s growth trajectory.



The need for certification -

IGI is in a sweet spot where certification need is only rising for both natural and LGD with certification companies being disproportionate winners in the fight between Natural Diamonds and Lab-grown Diamonds.

With rise in LGD’s, the need for certification for natural diamonds is on the rise, with differentiation being one of the key selling points for natural diamonds

Lab-grown diamonds are on a nascent stage, where LGD certification is following Natural Diamond certification to separate it from lower end jewelry such as one with American Diamonds.

Key risks
-The key risk for IGI is a steep drop in LGD prices which makes certification costs unviable. 

Overseas subsidiaries have performed poorly in CY24 and if these entities don’t turn-around they will be a drag on both profitability and margins in the years to come.Margin headwinds especially in India is likely as the company is adding employees in order to cater to volumes increasing.Conclusion - IGI’s competitive advantages, unparalleled financial economics and strong presence in a fast growing segment makes it an interesting business to evaluate.

However with the ever-evolving LGD segment and sharp pricing fluctuations, it can easily turn tailwind into a headwind especially historically highest margins.

Whether IGI will benefit from LGD boom is a question mark at the moment. Only time will tell.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"IGI Earnings Call Summary I was tracking the lab grown diamonds (LGD) market looking for promising investment opportunities. And I came across the recent IGI (International Gemological Institute) results and the earnings call since it is one of the key players in LGD value chain. Here is a very short and very quick summary for anyone who is interested. 

Key Financial highlights:

* Revenue from Operations up 9.6% YoY
* PAT up 11% YoY
* Volume (# reports generated) up 27% YoY
* EBITDA margin at 65%
* Average Realise Price (ARP) down 11% YoY but up 7% QoQ

Key themes I gathered from the earnings call:

* They recently finished up all the legal work on their acquisition of IGI Netherlands and IGI Belgium under IGI India making IGI India the hub of worldwide operations. This was funded from the IPO in December 2024. The Netherlands unit did quite well, however Belgium faced some headwinds, they attributed this to the geopolitical unrest in Europe and are optimistic about its performance once the situation there improves.
* They are constantly seeing rising volumes and this trend is expected to last as well thus have upped their employee strength by \~14% (added 130 people) and are also building a new state of the art facility in Surat
* The LGDs industry is at an inflection point with growing adoption in India and the rest of the world, and they are hugely optimistic about it and are betting big on it. Because with LGDs comes a greater need for certification as proof of origin. (So if the perception of LGDs changes for worse they could take a big hit)
* For them volume growth is expected to outpace value growth, courtesy of increasing component of LGDs in their revenue mix
* On LGD price volatility (because the value of the diamonds is one of the factors in their pricing as well) they said they don't expect another steep fall like the one from a year ago, since the current level of production costs for growers has ensure a floor that supports stability in price.
* They are also making quite a few investments in process re-engineering and technology to support sustained growth and improved customer experience (few key things that I picked up were Digital certifications and blockchain traceability, automation where possible.
* On the effect of tariffs on their business, they said that as they are in services business there shouldn't be a direct impact but there will definitely be some impact due to the impact of movement of diamonds, but it shouldn't be much.",1745398649.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k5uh17/igi_earnings_call_summary/

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"A Monopoly business trying hard to get better margins Monopolies businesses in growing sectors are considered to be one of the best compuders of money. 

Business like CAMs, MCX given immense returns to the investors. 

Dreamfolks one of the lounge aggregator operating in airport, railway and highway sector. 

Majority of India airport longues are already partner of dreamfolks. Internationally too they are expanding. 

As already expansion in airport had been done the growth is not going to come alone from new lounge addition. It actually going to come from increasing traffic with addition of newly added longue. Traffic is increasing by 7-9% year on year on airport that's going to bring revenue for them. 

Now from last 1 years they diversified into railway and highways. 

High traffic railway station are getting upgraded and longue are getting common on these station. Upper middle class not going in the waiting rooms. They are moving to longue for better experience. 

The new growth engine for them will be railway and highway sector. 

Everything is ok with this company. Clear service based model so no needs of capital to invest.

Recently added spa centres, golf club for experience of high networth customers. These are high margins products. 

Revenue is increase by 20% no issue with this. Problem with them is margins

We know most of the companies who brings IPOs try to do manipulation to say investors that they are very profitable. At the time of IPO dreamfolks too had ebita margins of 11-13%.

Last year they had 8%.

Now they are struggling with 8% of ebita margins. Company already knows that credit card companies going to shift on spend based model and that's going decrease their margins. Hence dreamfolks bought their IPO before this would happen. 

Now we should see 7% as stable margins for next few years. 

Needs to calculate what should be right valuation to the company. 

Revenue:-
2022- 282 cr- 8% margins

2023- 773 cr- 13% margins

2024- 1135-  8%

H1 2024- 638 crore- 7%

Clearly the growth in revenue is tremendous. Looking last 2 quarter we can Estimate growth could be around 20-23%.

Market cap of the company is 2000 crores
Last year profit is 69 crores. 

This is estimated to be 73-75 crores. 

Considering last year profit PE will be around 29.

This stock is listed at price of 430 and raise to 780 in july 2023.

From 780 it's started falling and till today it's going down and down. 

Current prices is 376 and Ipo price is 326. From ipo to  today revenue became double but margins are lower by 40%. In view of profitability this company is still at its IPO level. 

Negative chart of dreamfolks shows their is still room for stock  to go more down. If it's falls 20% more then valuation will be around 1600 crores. 

Profit this is 73-75 crores. 

Looking with this year profit PE will be around 22. That's the best PE multiple for stock whose revenue growth at 20%. Even if company maintain 7% of magins and grows revenue by 20 then profits easily can grow by 22-23% year on year basis. 

In this market there are very few companies which are growing with 20%revenue gowth and getting at valuation of 22-24 PE multiple. 

Just wait till 7 Feb 2025 and see how their ebita margins going to be in December quarter. Till that time I think may fall more 10-12%.

DII holding in range of 6-9% in last one year. 

FII sold as they are doing in indian market.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Analysis of the healthcare sector in India! Fellow redditors, since all of you showcased so much love on my last post, I am here to contribute more to this sub and hopefully enhance the quality of posts here. Today, I am going to be doing an extensive analysis of the healthcare sector in India. I believe that this is a very underpenetrated zone with robust growth potential. 

Spoiler: For those who are looking for stock recommendations, I’m going to save you some time and tell you that there are none in this post. I am not going to step into the same zone as certain finfluencers and tell you guys what to buy since I am not an advisor, nor are most of them btw. I am going to be giving a broad overview of what I think the healthcare sector is going to look like in a few years, the growth triggers and the general valuations. 

For those who struggle with reading long posts, I would say this is the time for you to try and go to chat gpt to ask for a summary and for chatGPT to miss out on the majority of the statistics and points that I will try and put forth. This is exactly how you end up having weak convictions in businesses. 

The following are my personal views supported by market forecasts and statistics.

I am sure a lot of you must be seeing a significant consolidation in your portfolios for the past few months. It is also hard to point out exactly what triggers are impacting the market, I think it was overheated valuations, but some might say it was the US imposing tariffs, stronger dollar or reallocation to other undervalued markets. While some might complain about the market collapsing and that stocks will never reach the same levels again (not my comments but things I’ve read on this subreddit), I believe that this is a great time for accumulation. I know a lot of us might be struggling with the fact that you might be 100% invested in the markets, if that is the case then just hold on to fundamentally strong companies and you should be good. For those who have cash on hand, this is a golden opportunity to slowly accumulate. 

Now coming to the healthcare industry. What is interesting to watch in market downturns is the fact that because investor sentiment is low and the markets are fearful, people tend to offload stock from all sectors, even the ones that might be doing well and are growing at a good pace. The great thing about this sector is that it cannot be impacted much by foreign policies or tariffs unlike the IT sector. India remains a highly under-penetrated zone when it comes to hospitals and there is a huge demand for more infrastructure. 

https://preview.redd.it/p9apgjlfvpje1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e3a915fb377dc696f0a1921756a9fcd9285f5de

When you have a look at this image, you can clearly see the lack of infrastructure we have. This was also highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was a large shortfall of availability of beds in hospitals. Since our population is similar to China, I would assume that our basic requirements should be close to theirs. I would not say that we should expect the average to go all the way up to 50 but I would assume somewhere around the 35 scale should be the target. This is again my own analysis; I would hope that we can at least achieve the world average. This is trigger number one.

Furthermore, since we all know the AQI levels around the country, which btw I don’t think will become better anytime soon, this will lead to further health issues in the long term. These are long term opportunities. Take major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Haryana where air quality is at its worst, people residing there will definitely need to seek medical services in the long term, nobody can sustain such harmful toxins. This is exactly why hospitals in North India are growing at a much faster pace when compared to any other side in India. 

https://preview.redd.it/pouj1e2dvpje1.jpg?width=1180&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14aad56bafaf19aeb1520fdcba8a35c58c5844ca

Even if we consider a mid-point growth of 10% Y-o-Y, then we can see just how big of a market this would be going in the future. The good thing about this is that we are currently at a stage where hospitals are rapidly expanding and you will see a lot of private chains making several acquisitions, this is all because they know the opportunities that lie ahead. Another major thing to consider is that government only has a fixed amount of Capex that they can deploy to fund or expand hospitals, which is why the burden is on the private sector to grow and fill the necessary gaps, this is really beneficial because we have a lot of private players who are already listed and some who are ready for an IPO. This is exactly why you will be seeing a shift in the market share that private hospitals have. Below is the forecasted change. 

[I believe that this is a very conservative forecast](https://preview.redd.it/q613rfawupje1.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e97a161c55ddcc21ccbae53bc3f6744e51b1efc)

Another important thing to keep an eye out for is the fact that the government has launched the ‘Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)’. For those of you who are not aware of this policy, this is an initiative that the government has taken to provide health coverage to all senior citizens of the age 70 years and above irrespective of income. This is aimed to benefit around 4.5 crore families. This is huge! This means that going forward people would prefer to seek private healthcare because they have a coverage of up to 5 lakhs. You can read more about this here:[AB PM-JAY | Prime minister of India](https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-health-coverage-to-all-senior-citizens-of-the-age-70-years-and-above-irrespective-of-income-under-ayushman-bharat-pradhan-mantri-jan-arogya-yojana-ab-pm-jay/). It has not even been a full year since the rollout began, which means that going forward we can see a lot more people visiting private hospitals. This is trigger number two. 

https://preview.redd.it/eetra9y3vpje1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcdf7bb4285de28e9bc37232b3e7f25f75126d34

There is clearly a very low concentration of private sector penetration, and this graph helps us visualize the market that is yet to be penetrated. 

Trigger number three is how cheap our medical facilities are when compared to the rest of the world. India holds a big price moat over the rest of the world when it comes to medical services. This is why we are witnessing a wave of medical tourism in India. This was something that was also mentioned in Budget 2025, the idea of “Heal in India”. This is an initiative that has the potential to bring a lot of money to India and obviously the government sees that and is trying to provide streamlined e-visa facilities along with visa-fee waivers for certain tourist groups. I would highly encourage you to read this: [Press Release: Press Information Bureau](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2099519). Below are the price comparisons between major countries to prices in India and you can clearly see the difference. 

https://preview.redd.it/0xzwggizupje1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2be4c9b78103c114f8a6815fa75fe27a23286ff

Medical tourism is growing at a very high pace at the moment. There was a time during the pandemic where it had slipped significantly, but we are starting to see a strong bounceback. I believe that if the sector plays its card correctly, then we can see a massive inflow of money. You can compare this to medical tourism in Korea as well; there is a significant incentive for people to fly to Korea for plastic surgeries due to the significant price difference. Their economy has massively benefitted from this! I believe that there are opportunities for our market to grow beyond that scale just because of our price competitiveness. 

[I believe that this forecast is pretty conservative, and that India has the potential to attract more than 30 lakh tourists by 2030e. ](https://preview.redd.it/qvhh5cr0vpje1.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceccd913db372a47f3819f4dd700f17c8e8e4512)

India is also starting to see more people buying health cover than before. This is very interesting because more people holding health insurance means that people would be visiting for every health issue they have instead of trying to seek cheap remedies and fixing the issue by themselves. Companies are also starting to offer health insurance as part of their employees' overall package, this means that more people are going to be holding more insurance policies going forward.

Something to keep an eye out for is that several healthcare companies have seen their shares significantly fall in the past months, even though most of the companies reported decent to good earnings. It is also important to point out that unlike a lot of sectors, healthcare is not cyclical, people don’t choose when they want to fall sick, therefore these are stocks which, regardless of market conditions, should be reporting numbers that are in-line with expectations. 

Some of the companies are available at great valuation at this point and there are also some that are trading at crazy prices. I would highly recommend that you do your due diligence of which business you want to invest in and try keeping an eye out for the points that I have highlighted. Good companies would be expanding and trying to capture the medical tourism market. Look for their geographical locations, the markets they are trying to cover and the level of specializations that they offer at their hospitals. I believe that this sector gets overlooked quite often by investors, however I feel that going forward, it has the opportunity to generate great wealth for investors. 

Of course, I cannot cover every single incentive or trigger for this industry in a single post, however I hope I have given you some coverage of what stage our country is currently at and what we can expect going forward. I would encourage you to do your own research to develop your own conviction. 

Would love to hear your opinions about this post and sector in the comments!

In a world where 70% of companies aren’t beating the index, it’s clear that not all mid and small caps are created equal. The tide that lifted all boats during the bull run has receded, and now it’s about finding the right boat.

Also consider your risk before investing Lumpsum, cause no one predict what would happen on a short term basis but need not worry for Longterm.


1) CDSL 
2) VBL
3) JSWENERGY
4) REC LIMITED
5) BLUESTARCO
6) KPITTECH
7) RIL 
8) CAMS


My reasons why I feel 

CDSL - India is witnessing a massive rise in retail investors and Demat account openings. CDSL has 75% market share so it benefits from Longterm demat account openings growth. Revenue depends on market conditions.

VBL - They are expanding rapidly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, as far I have read. Their revenue and profit has also been rising at great number on YoY basis.

JSW ENERGY - Most of their Renewable energy plants are to be made operational by the end of 2025 or first quarter of 2026, So I expect they will start to generate Revenue from 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2026.

REC Limited - They basically finance Power Sector, Almost 100% of their income comes from interests. I also read that they are expanding their business in Infrastructure Financing too, and at current PE of 6 it’s so worthy to add this in your portfolio.

BLUESTARCO - This company makes AC, Refrigerator, Coolers and few others. The rising global temperatures make this stock interesting and also the rising Data centers and Offices also gives this stock a great potential. Comparing with UAE which is 100% Airconditioned, our country is so far behind. Has potential due to its revenue and sales growth too.

KPITTECH - They provide Software solutions for Automobile companies mainly in Europe. I think they might benefit from Rising demand in EV. 

RELIANCE - No need to mention, It’s clearly visible they are slowly shifting towards Retail and Telecom. They are also planning an IPO for Jio this year. I trust Ambani and his big brains. 


CAMS - Just like CDSL but not stocks, they  manage Mutual funds transactions and also has 70% Market share. Just like cdsl this also moves based on Indias growth and mutual funds participation.

The promotor of the company keeps buying from the open market in tiny amounts in 2023, 2024 and 2025.  
The stock is down 40% from the high and currently trading below IPO price.  
The company is doing fine financially, not debt free though.  
The price is also so close to the support of 180.

Any thoughts?

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Hexaware IPO Analysis Hexaware IPO is priced at a P/E of 41. From analysis, we can see that the company is is performing well and growing consistently. However, from peer analysis, we can also conclude that the companies lies behind the consistent outperformers such as Persistent and Coforge. The company seems to be better positioned than Mphasis and LTIMindtree. Both Mphasis and LTIMindtree is currently trading at a range of 35x TTM PE and Coforge and Persistent are trading at a TTM PE of \~65x. I believe, the IPO to be correctly prices at PE of 41 and it’s highly unlikely that the market would reward the company with a higher multiple post listing.

Here's my views on why I picked each stock. I intend to keep the stocks for long term growth and not into trading at all. Would love to get some feedback on whether you feel it needs some adjustments:

* **PGEL, BLS, Hatsun, SFL:** Stable businesses showcasing strong growth over the years. Read through their annual reports and no major red flags. SFL is taking on the lion's share in the mattress business after the Kurlon acquisition so confident that it will help grow my money.
* **Gokex, VTL:** Given the crisis in Bangladesh, betting on these 2 stocks to take on a good share of textile export.
* **CastrolInd, Titan:** safe bets. A little skeptical about Castrol though. May sell with some profits and reinvest it in any other business.
* **NTPCGreen, EIEL:** Couldn't get those through IPO and looks like good businesses to invest in. Have a tiny bit of doubt in NTPCGreen since AdaniGreens seems to get favors from the current administration.

Portfolio is only 3 months old so beginners' luck, maybe?

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Ixigo IPO Analysis **Business**  
  
  
**Ixigo, started in 2007,** as a flight comparison website enabled travellers to research and compare relevant price information and book their preferred flight in a cost-efficient and informed manner from OTAs. **Ixigo later graduated to OTA( Online Travel Agent) in FY20**. **Ixigo is the 2nd largest OTA( Online Travel Agent) in terms of revenues, with 6% market share.**  
  
**They operate through 4 different apps Ixigo flights,Ixigo trains, ConfirmTkt and AbhiBus.** Ixigo is the largest Indian train ticket distributor in the OTA rail market with largest market share of around 51%, in terms of rail bookings, among OTAs. Their bus-focused app, AbhiBus, was the second largest bus-ticketing OTA in India, with a 11.5% market share in online bus ticket bookings in FY23. They had a market share in India of about 5.2% of the total airline OTA market by volume in H1 FY24. They have the highest app usage among OTAs with 83 million Monthly Active Users cumulatively across our apps.  
However, within each of their apps, they integrate and cross-sell all services they operate to ensure that users may not necessarily require another app ,like users can book a flight on the ixigo train app or ConfirmTkt and a bus journey on the ixigo flight app, and a train ticket on the AbhiBus app allowing them to discover and buy multiple travel services.  
  
  
**Product segments**  
  
**1. Airline ticketing**  
  
Ixigo commenced operations in 2007 in the flight vertical by launching a travel meta-search website - providing aggregated comparison of deals and accurate travel information. **Later in FY20, they transitioned to an OTA**.  
  
**2. Rail**  
  
They launched the ixigo trains app for android in 2013 as a utility app with the objective of improving the experience of Indian train travellers by allowing them to search for train related information and providing utility services. Subsequently, in **2017, Ixigo started selling train tickets** through their Ixigo trains app.  
  
**3. Bus tickets**  
  
Bus accounts for 70% of transport modes in India. Ixigo sells bus tickets by partnering either directly with operators or source inventory from bus ticketing aggregators in the country.They acquired the business of **AbhiBus in 2021** to further consolidate their position.  
  
**4. Hotels**  
  
In **December 2023**, Ixigo have launched a hotel booking section on their website and apps to allow users the ability to search, compare and book hotels on their own platforms in India and across the world. They offer properties across domestic and international hotels, spanning budget, mid-range and luxury price points.  
  
  
90% of users of Ixigo are organic users. Ixigo has market share amongst OTAs in terms of volumes - flight 5.3%, rail 53%, bus 13%.  
In July 2023,Ixigo became the first OTA in India to launch a Generative AI based travel planning tool named PLAN to help travellers plan their trip, get itineraries and real time information and recommendations based on input criteria.

The surge in affordable smartphone users is expected to reach 1 billion users by 2026, according to TRAI. This, coupled with high speed internet connectivity( launch of 4G/ 5G) will drive online bookings.

The ability of OTAs to offer value added services that offer additional protection and refund guarantees such as zero cancellation fee programmes, fully refundable and flexible ticket types, price protection, travel insurance etc. and their ability to bundle in multiple types of services in one transaction.

A shift in demographics of overall travellers to the age group of 18–35 years who are dominating the Indian travel scene, comprising almost 66% of the overall trips.  


Market leader is MakeMyTrip with 24% market share, and other players are Ixigo, Easemytrip, Cleartrip. Ixigo’s market share of the overall OTA market (flights, trains, hotels and buses) by GTV stood at 6% in FY23.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"22-Year-Old New Earner Seeking Long-Term Investment Advice on Mutual Funds and Stocks Hi everyone,

I'm 22 years old and recently started working at an MNC in Navi Mumbai, earning 40,000 INR/month. I live with my parents, so I don't have major financial responsibilities right now. My only regular expense is about 1,500 INR/month for a local train pass and auto rickshaw. I avoid unnecessary spending, and the rest of my salary is currently sitting idle in my savings account.

For additional context:

My family owns two houses. One is still on loan, primarily for tax-saving purposes.

My father, 51, also works and earns enough to support our family comfortably.

I don't have any immediate goals like purchasing a house or car, and I plan to invest for the long term (10+ years).


So far, I’ve invested in:

1. Waaree Energies: 1 lot acquired through IPO.


2. NTPC Green Energy: 2 lots acquired through IPO (considering selling now and buying later at a discount).


3. Motilal Oswal Mid Cap Direct Growth Fund: 10,000 INR.



I’m looking to further diversify my investments and would love advice on:

1. Mutual funds that are beginner-friendly with a good track record for long-term growth (e.g., index funds, ELSS, etc.).


2. Stocks suitable for a long-term investor who wants to learn and grow in the equity market (preferably blue-chip or stable growth stocks).


3. Strategies for balancing my investments (how much to put in mutual funds vs. stocks).


Additionally, if there are better ways to optimize my portfolio considering my family already benefits from a tax-saving home loan, I’d appreciate your insights.


I’d also love recommendations for learning resources about investing and portfolio management.

Thanks in advance for your guidance!",1733582602.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1h8tw76/22yearold_new_earner_seeking_longterm_investment/

Just a beginner here (both on reddit and the stock market) asking for some suggestions.

I've strated investing only recently (around 6 months ago). Currently my portfolio looks like -

Motilal Oswal midcap (₹6k PM),
Tata small cap fund (₹6k PM),
Icici prudential bluechip prudential fund (₹500 PM),
Quant ELSS tax saver fund (₹500 PM),
PGMI india midcap opportunities fund (₹4k PM),
Navi nifty 50 index fund (₹2.5k PM).

I'm thinking of thinning it down since before I was a little clueless and I'm now checking the expense ratio, sharpe ration, etc (not sure if I'm correct here though?)

Motilal Oswal Midcap (₹6k),
Tata smallcap fund (₹6k),
Nippon India large cap (₹6k),
Very small quantities in Quant and icici bluechip (since they're just consistently in red) - keeping it at 500 each.

Need a suggestion for one or two more SIPs that I can invest into? I can afford to invest 5-6k more

Apart from this I've also invested in a few small cases -

Pharma tracker by windmill capital,
Equity and Gold (SIPd),
All weather investing (SIPd),
Top 100 stocks.

I'm not sure if smallcase would be the best way to go with investing into stocks though. Also I've recently even gotten the VMM IPO and I've also applied for Mamath Machinery IPO and Senores pharmaceuticals IPO.

Apologies for the long post but just wanted to know your thoughts on how it looks like and how can I improve it. (Currently both the overall stocks and SIP portfolio in green, not by much though)

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Swiggy IPO in the first week of November  Swiggy is coming up with its IPO in the first week of November. Here is a short summary of the IPO:

• IPO Size: The total size of Swiggy’s IPO, including the offer for sale, is projected to be between INR 11,700 Cr and INR 11,800 Cr.

• Subscription Dates: The IPO will open for public subscription from November 6 and close on November 8, with anchor investor bidding set for November 5.

• Valuation: Swiggy has significantly reduced its valuation target to $11.3 billion, just above its last private valuation of $10.7 billion. This is a sharp decline from the previously anticipated $15 billion target.

• Market Context: The Indian stock market has recently seen a decline, with benchmark indices falling about 8% since reaching all-time highs last month. Competitor Zomato is currently valued at over $26 billion.

• Issue Composition: The IPO will include a fresh issuance of shares worth INR 4,500 Cr, increased from the initial INR 3,750 Cr, alongside an offer for sale of 18.53 million equity shares.

• Financial Performance: Swiggy reported an 8% year-on-year increase in net loss to INR 611 Cr for the June quarter of 2024, while operating revenue grew 35% YoY to INR 3,222.2 Cr.

• New Services: Ahead of the IPO, Swiggy is launching new offerings, including a 10-minute medicine delivery service in Bengaluru, international login for NRIs to order food and groceries in India, and a concierge service for high-end customers.

• It is also pertinent to note that the targeted valuation would be about $2 Bn short of what Swiggy’s investor Invesco last valued the startup at. Earlier this month, Invesco marked up Swiggy’s valuation by 25% to $13.3 Bn.

• Recently, Swiggy also received the nod from its shareholders to increase the fresh issue size to INR 5,000 Cr from the initial INR 3,750 Cr.

This IPO marks a significant moment for Swiggy as it seeks to navigate a challenging market landscape while competing against established players like Zomato.

Reddit,sattva ipo,"Should I invest in India's biggest office REIT IPO? India’s biggest office REIT IPO, Knowledge Realty Trust, is opening for subscription on August 5, 2025, with a price band of ₹95–₹100 per unit and a minimum investment of ₹15,000. Backed by Blackstone and Sattva, KRT REIT will become the country’s largest and most geographically diverse office REIT upon listing, with an asset base of ₹62,000 crore, 46.3 million sq ft of premium, well-leased office space in major metros, and a diversified tenant base of blue-chip companies.

Key points for your decision:

* The management projects a starting dividend yield of 7.2%, aiming to average 7.7% in the first three years. REITs must pay out 90% of income, so expect steady quarterly payouts.
* Over 95% of your money goes straight to debt reduction, lowering KRT’s leverage and strengthening its financial profile.
* The REIT targets a 13% CAGR in net operating income till 2029, with future expansion planned across top office markets.
* Units are listed on BSE/NSE, making it easy to exit, and you get regular, SEBI-mandated disclosures.

**Risks:**

1. Office REITs are sensitive to economic cycles.
2. Rising interest rates or competing asset classes can pressure REIT valuations.
3. Commercial property cycles can be volatile over the short term.

If your goal is regular income and you’re OK with property market volatility, a moderate allocation makes sense. Otherwise, there’s no rush. Feel free to watch its quarterly performance for a couple of cycles before jumping in.",1753951695.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1mdwcyg/should_i_invest_in_indias_biggest_office_reit_ipo/

Reddit,anlon ipo,"Should you subscribe to the Anlon Healthcare IPO? RISKS explained!!! Anlon Healthcare, operational since 2017, specializes in manufacturing high-purity pharmaceutical intermediates and APIs. The company operates from a single WHO-GMP and ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Rajkot, Gujarat, with a current production capacity of 400 MTPA, utilized at 84% in FY25. The company's product portfolio has 65 commercialized products, with an additional 28 products in the pilot stage and 49 products under laboratory testing. Notably, Anlon is among the few Indian manufacturers of Loxoprofen Sodium Dihydrate, a specialized API used for pain management in conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and post-surgical recovery.

There are four segments: APIs (40.27% of revenue), Finished Dosage Formulations (53.12%), Nutraceuticals (6.61%), and other segments (0.01%). 

Let's understand the **IPO structure**

The IPO comprises entirely a fresh issue of 1.33 crore equity shares priced between ₹86-91 per share, with a face value of ₹10. The lot size is fixed at 164 shares. 

Now, I will talk about its **financial performance**



||
||
|**Metric** (₹ Crores)|**FY23**|**FY24**|**FY25**|
|Revenue|112.9|66.69|120.46|
|EBITDA|N/A|15.57 |32.38 |
|Net Profit|5.82|9.66|20.52 |



The P/E multiple of 14.3x positions Anlon at a significant discount to peers like AMI Organics (58.5x) and Supriya Lifesciences (29.3x). 

The company has outlined an ambitious expansion strategy centered on capacity enhancement and market diversification. Plans include establishing a new 700 MTPA manufacturing facility within 400 meters of the existing plant, which would increase total capacity to 1,100 MTPA.

**Use of IPO Proceeds** (₹121.03 crores):

1. Capital Expenditure: ₹30.72 crores (25.4%) for facility expansion
2. Working Capital: ₹43.15 crores (35.7%) for operational scaling
3. Debt Repayment: ₹5.00 crores (4.1%) for financial optimization
4. General Corporate Purposes: ₹42.16 crores (34.8%)

The company has filed 21 DMFs across regulated markets including the EU, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Jordan, and Pakistan. Approvals have been secured from ANVISA (Brazil), NMPA (China), and PMDA (Japan) for key products.

**But** Anlon Healthcare faces multiple high-impact risks that potential investors must carefully evaluate.

1. The company's entire manufacturing operation is concentrated in one facility in Rajkot, Gujarat. Any disruption from regulatory issues, natural disasters, or equipment failures could severely impact operations.
2. Approximately 77% of revenue comes from the top 10 customer. Loss of any major customer could significantly impact financial performance.
3.  Despite international regulatory approvals, exports constitute only 3% of total revenue.
4. The company's revenue pattern shows extreme fluctuations, dropping 40.9% in FY24 before surging 80.6% in FY25. So, there are questions about business predictability and sustainability.
5. Top 10 suppliers account for 90% of raw material procurement, creating supply chain vulnerability and potential margin pressure.
6. The API sector faces intense competition from Chinese manufacturers who benefit from cost advantages and scale. China controls approximately two-thirds of India's API imports, creating pricing pressure.
7. The chemical manufacturing sector faces increasing environmental regulations, with potential for production shutdowns due to compliance issues.

The Indian API market presents a robust growth opportunity, valued at $14.18 billion in 2025 and expected to reach $21.46 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 8.54%. India contributes 8.8% of global API production and benefits from the China+1 diversification strategy as global pharmaceutical companies seek alternative suppliers.

**VERDICT**

For Conservative Investors: **AVOID**

In Q1 FY2026, the firm reported ₹352 crore in revenue (up 11.3%) and ₹43.3 crore PAT (up 69.7%), with operating margins improving to 21.36%.

Currently, I’m investing ₹40K through SIPs, and my overall portfolio has a 35% allocation to growth-oriented funds, with an XIRR of 17%.

I've created a new list of funds with the goal of achieving a 15–20% CAGR, and I’m planning to increase my SIP budget to ₹80K. Could you please review the selected funds and let me know:

* Whether these funds align with my 15–20% CAGR target.
* If any of the selected funds should be removed or replaced.
* Any additional funds you would recommend adding to the portfolio to improve performance and diversification.

- **Category chosen:** B-HNI  
- **Minimum B-HNI shares applied (68 lots):** 884 shares expected
- **S-HNI minimum allotment (14 lots):** 182 shares
- **Actual shares allotted:** 182 shares

Thankful to have received an allotment despite the massive demand (NII portion oversubscribed by 22.4x, overall IPO by 54x). However, I’m genuinely puzzled — since the application was under B-HNI, shouldn’t successful applicants get at least the B-HNI minimum shares, not S-HNI?

Has anyone else in B-HNI received only the S-HNI minimum? Is this standard in heavily oversubscribed IPOs, or was something different in LG Electronics? Would appreciate any insights.

**Numbers for reference:**  
- S-HNI minimum: 182 shares (₹2 lakh+)
- B-HNI minimum: 884 shares (₹10 lakh+)
- Allotted: 182 shares

Reddit,lg ipo,"Can anyone help me understand with LG IPO analysis? LG IPO is something to study for.

A company with leading position , having superior RoNW and Higher EPS then peers should generally command a premium valuation and not 38 - 42% discounted valuation. The fact that book runners are pricing it so conservatively despite QIB Demand is a question of Fact that they are deployng 5 Book managers itself says they are trying to garuntee a sucess and not monetize it. 



When you closely observe the IPO

1. The Outflow ratio is 117%, on top of it they have extracted ₹ 45,817Cr in last 2 years, which is more then the IPO ask i.e. ₹ 11,607 cr 

2. Parent Company's Global performance is struggling, the topline CAGR is 3% with collapsing margins, while Indian entity is growing at 28% PAT CAGR. This shows that parent entity is higly depenedn on Indian asset, On top of it  Indian entity contributes to 50% of LG Holdings dividend recieved from Electronics verticle.  

3. LG Holding lost the equity value by 76% , and Electronics value lost is by 36%. So it needs a desperate proof to show a new value creation to its Korean Investors, and best way to create value addition is to tap and use capital market bull runs in india. there fore i assuem they wanted a 100% sucess in this IPO just to balance LG Holding equity value creation for Korean investors. 



This are my assumptions based on the filed DHRP reports, but i am sure many news and other outlets have more insider informations then me. Then why didnt anyone covered this aspects?



This IPO narrative is created as under valued listing which it definetely is, but if you look from LG holdings / LG Electronics INC (Parent company) its clearly a distress sale with value creation as their main motive.

Rubicon’s revenue rose 49% year-over-year, reaching ₹1,296 crore in FY2025 from ₹872 crore in FY2024, while net profit jumped 48% to ₹134 crore. In Q1 FY2026, the firm reported ₹352 crore in revenue (up 11.3%) and ₹43.3 crore PAT (up 69.7%), with operating margins improving to 21.36%. EBITDA margins expanded consistently from 10.5% in FY2023 to 20.7% in FY2025, showcasing operational efficiency.

1. Tata Steel and 6 other stocks are showing a Bullish RSI upswing. This indicates potential upward movement, and I'm considering adding some of these to my watchlist if they align with my algo triggers.

2. The Nifty 50 is eyeing a third session of gains, while Bank Nifty aims to reclaim 55,800. The indices could be on a bullish trend today, and I'm thinking of going long on banks if the momentum sustains.

3. Tata Capital and LG are launching IPOs which might drain liquidity from the secondary markets. This could lead to less trading action in some stocks, and I may need to adjust my strategies if liquidity becomes an issue.

4. WeWork India is outperforming its peers in revenue and profitability despite having a smaller footprint. This could make the real estate sector intriguing, and I might explore options in this space if my algos find suitable entry points.

5. Ceigall India's recent project wins worth Rs 1,309 crore have put its shares in focus. Infrastructure stocks might see some interest, and I'm considering a closer look to see if there's a trend I can capitalize on.

Reddit,lg ipo,"Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024^ We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

Reddit,mittal sections ipo,"You won’t find these stocks on Zerodha and there is a good reason for that. Over the past few years, I have noticed a growing buzz around a high-risk asset class: unlisted shares.

And no, I’m not talking about early stage startups like Zepto.

I am referring to established names like:

* NSE (National Stock Exchange) - up nearly 30% YoY in the unlisted space
* Tata Capital - gaining solid investor interest

But before you get carried away, let me be clear, this is not meant for retail investors.

Unlisted shares are highly risky and illiquid. They're typically suited for HNIs and UHNIs who have access to deep networks, extensive due diligence, and the financial muscle to handle potential losses.

Here are two key red flags to watch out for:

* Lack of liquidity - You might not find a buyer when you want to sell
* [Post-IPO](https://web.stockedge.com/ipo?section=listed-ipo) lock-in - Even after listing, there's a 6-month lock-in period for unlisted investors

Unless you are well-informed and financially resilient, the risks in unlisted shares can far outweigh the potential rewards.

I'm currently studying a few cases purely from a research perspective..

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Tata Capital share price opens modestly. What does this mean for NBFC IPO valuations? Tata Capital share price listed at ₹330, just one percent above its IPO price of ₹326, which feels modest compared with some of the high-profile listings earlier this year. The IPO raised ₹15,511 crore and was subscribed 1.95 times, with large investors taking the majority of the allocation while retail interest stayed low. The grey market was flat before listing.

Analysts note that Tata Capital is aiming to bring its credit cost below one percent by improving underwriting, which could make the stock story more attractive if successful. What valuation metrics would you use for an NBFC now, whether price to earnings, price to book, or return on assets? Does this muted Tata Capital share price give a chance to invest in a steady franchise or is it a sign to be cautious with new NBFC IPOs?

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Automation in Indian Stock Markets: Consistency is Key hey guys I have curated some news articles for my trading setup today

1. Tata Steel and 6 other stocks are showing a Bullish RSI upswing. This indicates potential upward movement, and I'm considering adding some of these to my watchlist if they align with my algo triggers.

2. The Nifty 50 is eyeing a third session of gains, while Bank Nifty aims to reclaim 55,800. The indices could be on a bullish trend today, and I'm thinking of going long on banks if the momentum sustains.

3. Tata Capital and LG are launching IPOs which might drain liquidity from the secondary markets. This could lead to less trading action in some stocks, and I may need to adjust my strategies if liquidity becomes an issue.

4. WeWork India is outperforming its peers in revenue and profitability despite having a smaller footprint. This could make the real estate sector intriguing, and I might explore options in this space if my algos find suitable entry points.

5. Ceigall India's recent project wins worth Rs 1,309 crore have put its shares in focus. Infrastructure stocks might see some interest, and I'm considering a closer look to see if there's a trend I can capitalize on.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Automation and Consistent Trading in Indian Markets hey guys I have curated some news articles for my trading setup today

1. IPO Party Continues: Dalal Street is buzzing with 21 new public issues and 26 companies set to debut. I'm watching these IPOs closely, as new listings often bring volatility and opportunities for short-term trades.

2. Market Correction Alert: HDFC Securities' Varun Lohchab suggests a potential 5–6% market correction due to global volatility. If volatility picks up, I may sell straddles to capitalize on market swings.

3. Stocks in Focus: Companies like Tata Motors, Waaree Energies, and HDFC Bank are in the spotlight. I'm thinking of going long on these stocks if they show strength, especially with Tata Motors' consistent performance.

4. Nifty 50 Changes: Max Healthcare and InterGlobe Aviation are set to join Nifty 50, with expected inflows of $1 billion. This could bring some bullish momentum to these stocks, and I might look at options strategies to play the potential upside.

5. Tata Capital's Valuation Trim: Tata Capital has trimmed its valuation to $15.7 billion ahead of its IPO launch. I'll be keeping an eye on this development, as it might affect market sentiment around financial services stocks.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"You won’t find these stocks on Zerodha and there is a good reason for that. Over the past few years, I have noticed a growing buzz around a high-risk asset class: unlisted shares.

And no, I’m not talking about early stage startups like Zepto.

I am referring to established names like:

* NSE (National Stock Exchange) - up nearly 30% YoY in the unlisted space
* Tata Capital - gaining solid investor interest

But before you get carried away, let me be clear, this is not meant for retail investors.

Unlisted shares are highly risky and illiquid. They're typically suited for HNIs and UHNIs who have access to deep networks, extensive due diligence, and the financial muscle to handle potential losses.

Here are two key red flags to watch out for:

* Lack of liquidity - You might not find a buyer when you want to sell
* [Post-IPO](https://web.stockedge.com/ipo?section=listed-ipo) lock-in - Even after listing, there's a 6-month lock-in period for unlisted investors

Unless you are well-informed and financially resilient, the risks in unlisted shares can far outweigh the potential rewards.

I'm currently studying a few cases purely from a research perspective..

Would love to hear your take in the comments.",1748932741.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1l250uk/you_wont_find_these_stocks_on_zerodha_and_there/
Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024^ We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

In his detailed response, Kamath explained that Zerodha started with just around ₹10 lakhs in total costs, with no big family backing — his father was a bank manager and his mother a Veena teacher. He emphasized how much of their rise was about being in the right place at the right time, as India’s markets were also booming. Kamath pointed out that since Zerodha never raised outside capital, they don’t face pressure to provide investor exits, which allows them to focus on customer-first decisions such as their no spam and no tracking policy.

[Sector-wise Performance Comparison: Dividend Yield, ROE, and 10-Year CAGR](https://preview.redd.it/1b2hibk9a4nf1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a3e45ff4ded256dd85e62827dfedc7127845e6d)

# Sector-wise Investment Strategy

# FMCG Sector: The Dividend Aristocrats

**Average Dividend Yield:** 2.75% | **ROE:** 22.9% | **10Y CAGR:** 14.0%

FMCG companies like ITC and Hindustan Unilever offer the most reliable dividend income due to their defensive characteristics and consistent cash generation. These companies benefit from:

* Inelastic demand during economic downturns
* Strong pricing power during inflationary periods
* Established distribution networks
* Brand loyalty and market leadership

**Recommended Allocation:** 40-50% of dividend portfolio

# Banking Sector: Growth with Stability

**Average Dividend Yield:** 1.2% | **ROE:** 17.2% | **10Y CAGR:** 20.4%

HDFC Bank represents the best of Indian banking with consistent dividend growth and superior financial metrics. Banking stocks offer:

* Benefit from India's GDP growth and financial inclusion
* Improving asset quality and digitization
* Lower dividend yields but higher capital appreciation potential

**Recommended Allocation:** 20-30% of dividend portfolio

# IT Services: Global Growth Story

**Average Dividend Yield:** 3.6% | **ROE:** 31.0% | **10Y CAGR:** 15.15%

TCS and Infosys combine attractive dividend yields with global growth exposure. Benefits include:

* Dollar revenue providing natural hedge
* Growing demand for digital services
* Strong cash conversion and capital-light business models
* Consistent dividend policies with special payouts

**Recommended Allocation:** 20-30% of dividend portfolio

# Risk Assessment and Limitations

# Inflation Impact

Indian dividend stocks face several inflation-related challenges :

* **Rising input costs** reduce profit margins for manufacturing companies
* **Interest rate hikes** by RBI make fixed deposits more attractive than dividend yields
* **Currency depreciation** affects import-dependent sectors
* **Commodity price volatility** impacts energy and mining stocks

**Mitigation Strategy:** Focus on companies with pricing power like Asian Paints and FMCG giants that can pass through cost increases.

# Regulatory and Tax Risks

* **Dividend taxation** shifted to investors post-2020, increasing effective tax burden
* **Sector-specific regulations** affect tobacco (ITC), banking, and energy companies
* **Environmental regulations** pose long-term risks to Coal India and ONGC
* **Competition from REITs and bonds** for income-seeking investors

# Market and Economic Risks

* **Economic slowdown** can force companies to cut dividends during downturns
* **Corporate governance issues** in some PSU companies
* **Global economic uncertainty** affecting IT services and export-oriented companies
* **Technology disruption** threatening traditional business models

# Long-Term Return Projections

# Conservative Dividend Portfolio Strategy

**Expected Returns:** 12% capital appreciation + 2.8% dividend yield = **14.8% total returns**

**Portfolio Composition:**

* 50% FMCG (ITC, HUL)

* 20% Quality Large-caps (Asian Paints)

**Projected Returns on ₹10 Lakh Investment:**

* **10 Years:** ₹39.8 lakhs | Annual Dividend: ₹1.1 lakhs
* **20 Years:** ₹1.58 crores | Annual Dividend: ₹4.4 lakhs
* **30 Years:** ₹6.28 crores | Annual Dividend: ₹17.6 lakhs
* **50 Years:** ₹99.3 crores | Annual Dividend: ₹2.78 crores

# Aggressive Dividend Portfolio Strategy

**Expected Returns:** 14.5% capital appreciation + 4.2% dividend yield = **18.7% total returns**

**Portfolio Composition:**

* 30% High-yield PSUs (Coal India, ONGC)
* 40% IT Services (TCS, Infosys)
* 30% Premium FMCG/Paints (ITC, Asian Paints)

* High-Yield PSUs (25%): Coal India (15%) + ONGC (10%)
* Quality Growth (35%): ITC (15%) + Asian Paints (10%) + HDFC Bank (10%)

**Expected Portfolio Yield:** 3.8% with 16-18% total returns

# Key Success Factors for 50-Year Wealth Creation

# Dividend Reinvestment Strategy

* **Automatic reinvestment** of all dividend income to compound returns
* **Systematic addition** of ₹25,000-50,000 annually through SIPs
* **Rebalancing** portfolio every 2-3 years to maintain target allocation

# Quality Over Yield

* Prioritize companies with **sustainable competitive advantages**
* Focus on **dividend growth** rather than just high current yields
* Avoid dividend traps in declining industries

# Long-Term Mindset

* **Hold through market cycles** without panic selling
* **Increase allocation** during market downturns for higher yields
* **Stay committed** to dividend reinvestment for 20+ years minimum

The combination of India's economic growth, demographic dividend, and these fundamentally strong dividend-paying companies can potentially create substantial wealth over 50 years, with the aggressive strategy potentially turning ₹10 lakh into over ₹500 crores through the power of compounding and dividend reinvestment.

CDSL (2017): 149 → 1800+

Esaf Small Finance Bank - Dropped 36% from 60 IPO

There could be more from both the sides, but these were the main highlighted.

Lesson:
IPOs can create immense wealth but only when:
The business is strong, scalable & profitable
Valuation is fair, not inflated
You hold with patience, not for instant gains
Hype sells value builds.

Choose wisely, research deeply, and think long-term.

Reddit,tata capital ipo,"Tata Motors' Demerger: What Investors Should Know Before October 2025 Tata Motors, India's largest automobile manufacturer, will start historic restructuring from October 1, 2025, when the firm will officially demerge into two distinct, separately listed companies. The demerger, overwhelmingly approved by shareholders in the first half of this year, is to be realized through sharper strategic focus, better capital allocation, and unlocking shareholder value.

# The Structure of the Demerger

As per the approved strategy, Tata Motors shall be demerged into:

* **TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd.** – the new entity encompassing the commercial vehicle (CV) operations, truck and buses, and the heavy duty mobility solutions.
* **Passenger Car Business (Jaguar Land Rover and Electric Vehicles)** – to continue in current Tata Motors Ltd.

Both the companies will list and trade separately on the NSE and BSE, so investors can analyze them on two different fundamentals.

# Shareholding Effect

Its demerger will be **finalized through allotment of shares 1:1**. For each share of Tata Motors owned as of the record date (shortly to be disclosed), shareholders will be issued:

* 1 stake in Tata Motors Ltd. (Passenger Vehicles + JLR)
* 1 TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd. equity share.

Trading of the shares of the new CV entity would soon thereafter take place upon fulfillment of listing formalities.

# Justification of the Action

Management at Tata Motors contends that the two firms possess different operating fundamentals and market opportunities:

* **Commercial Vehicles (CV):** It is a cyclical, capital-intensive industry fueled by infrastructure needs, fleet replenishment, and regulatory requirements.
* **Passenger Automobiles and JLR:** Growth-oriented businesses with emphasis on electric vehicle segment, global automobile, and export markets by Jaguar Land Rover.

By isolating the businesses, Tata Motors also anticipates:

* Greater functional focus within every business unit.
* Simpler value parameters, clearer investor disclosure of financial performance.
* Independent capital raising through matching each segment's strategy.

# Market & Analyst Comments

Analysts see the demerger as value-unlocking transaction:

The CV sector can attract investors seeking security and controllable cash flows.

PV + JLR has investor appeal for those wanting to expand, particularly Tata Motors' foray into electric cars and JLR's price leadership.

Some also mention potential pitfalls:

* Overcoming transitional costs and authorization approvals.
* Volatility during the listing of the new CV entity as investors rebalance portfolios.
* Global headwinds of JLR, including risks from currencies and luxury cycle requirements.

# Where Are the Next Levels of TMPV and TMLCV's Stock Prices Going?

After the demerger, Tata Motors shareholders will be the owners of interest in both the new companies -Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV, including Jaguar Land Rover and EV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles (TMLCV).

It is to be noted:

Overall, the combined market value of the TMPV and TMLCV will be the total of Tata Motors' value before demerger, although actual results will be at the discretion of market forces.

**Shares of both the companies will not be divided equally**. The stocks of both the companies shall be opened for trading by the exchange during a pre-open period subject to supply and demand. Once they are separated, the two stocks will be traded individually, with investors valuing each firm by its own merits -growth prospects, profitability, and market standing.

That is, although the collective economic interest of shareholders is the same at allocation, disclosure of value allocation between TMPV and TMLCV will be revealed by market discovery, not at a pre-specified divide.

# What's to Come

**Record Date Announcement:** The Tata Motors shareholder cut-off date will be determined later around October 2025.

**Listing of CV Business:** Expected in Q2 FY26, after statutory clearances. 

**Operating Autonomy:** The two organizations will have their own boards, with minimal overlap. Conclusion Tata Motors demerger is among India's largest corporate restructuring exercises in the auto space over the past few years. As an option for shareholders, it provides them with two distinctively focused businesses and two different growth streams. 

For the overall market, it is a sign of moving towards Indian corporate world's specialization and efficiency. Whether all of this restructuring creates sustainable shareholder value will be determined by execution, market forces, and the strategic suppleness of the two resulting businesses.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Tomorrow Market Prediction: Market Recap, Levels & Strategies for September 24, 2025 Hello and welcome back to Replete Equities! If trading or investing in the Indian stock market is your game, then this update is for you. We’re breaking down today’s market action and what it means for tomorrow, September 24, 2025. From Nifty and Bank Nifty key levels to option market insights and fresh news, here’s everything you need to approach tomorrow’s trading with confidence.

1. Market Recap: September 23, 2025 – A Day of Consolidation and Caution

Nifty 50 slipped slightly, closing down 32.85 points (−0.13%) at 25,169.50. The trading range for the day was between 25,246.25 and 25,085—reflecting a cautious market that failed to hold onto early gains. Midcap and smallcap indices followed suit, edging lower by about half a percent.

Bank Nifty saw similar cautious sentiment, closing modestly lower at 55,248.70, with intraday swings between 55,624 and 55,143.

In terms of sector performance, banking and metals showed resilience and helped contain downside pressure, while FMCG stocks faced some selling. Big movers on the upside were IndusInd Bank, JSW Steel, Axis Bank, and Bajaj Finance. On the downside, weaker stocks included Trent, Tech Mahindra, SBI Life, UltraTech Cement, and HUL.

The overall market breadth remained negative, confirming a day of profit-booking and sideways movement.

2. Key Support & Resistance Levels to Watch Tomorrow:

Knowing where the market might find footing or hit a wall helps you position better. Here’s the precise outlook for both key indices:

Nifty 50:

I. Support: 25,100 (immediate), followed by 25,060–25,030 zone. The broader 24,900 to 25,000 zone remains a critical medium-term safety net.
II. Resistance: 25,200–25,250 in the short term, then 25,400, which has strong call option writing confirming resistance in this band.

Nifty is under pressure but holding above crucial support, indicating potential for consolidation or mild recovery if 25,100 holds firm.

Bank Nifty:

I. Support: 55,100 first line of defense; if broken, watch next at 55,000.
II. Resistance: 55,500–55,600, then 56,000 on a strong breakout.

Bank Nifty’s near-term moves will be highly dependent on these key pivot points. A move above resistance levels could signal fresh bullish momentum, while a break down may intensify caution.

3. Option Chain Insights: What the Market’s Big Players are Signaling;

The option chain data reveals market expectations and potential volatility zones:

Nifty: The heaviest call open interest clusters around the 25,400–25,500 strikes, marking strong resistance caps. Conversely, put open interest peaks at 25,100 and 25,000 provide vital support levels. Interesting to note is substantial option writing at the 25,200 strike on both calls and puts, suggesting the market anticipates rangebound movement near that level unless influenced by substantial news. The put-call ratio (PCR) is balanced, showing no dominant bias at this point.

Bank Nifty: Peaks in open interest appear at 55,000 (put side – support) and 56, 000 (call side – resistance). This indicates anticipated consolidation and potential for sharp moves only if these critical levels are decisively broken. With the weekly expiry approaching soon, expect these pivots to be key decision zones for traders.


4. Key News and Market Triggers for Tomorrow:

I. Global cues remain mixed. Asian markets showed some pressure while US markets remained steady, adding layers of uncertainty for Indian markets. Crude oil and currency movements continue to keep traders on toes.

II. IPO happenings: The Ganesh Consumer Products IPO continues but with muted subscriber interest. Its performance over the coming days remains a point of attention for market participants.

III. No impactful bulk deals or major policy announcements were seen today, keeping the market mostly driven by sector-specific and global cues.
What’s the Sentiment? Trading Advice for Tomorrow

5. The tone is cautious and slightly negative. Here’s what to keep in mind:

I. For Nifty, maintain a neutral to mildly bearish stance between 25,050 and 25,250.
Buyers should consider entering near the lower support zones (around 25,100), but keep tight stops if prices drop below 25,000.

II. For Bank Nifty, bulls should look for a clear breakout above 55,500 before committing more capital. Falling below 55,000 should raise alarm bells and encourage risk reduction.

III. Sector wise, tread carefully, especially avoiding IT stocks, which face headwinds related to US H-1B visa fee hikes. Consumption and industrials may offer better relative strength in this phase.

IV. Volatility indexes are elevated — adopting spread strategies picking rangebound moves is a safer bet than outright directional bets.

Overall, expect choppy, range-bound trading until fresh catalysts emerge. Play the range and be ready for quick exits.

6. Final Thoughts: Stay Prepared, Stay Nimble

Markets are showing more resistance to upside moves but aren’t ready for a full turnaround either. The best approach for tomorrow is to remain nimble, keep stops close, and watch those technical levels closely. Volatility remains your friend if you trade smartly, and risk management will be your best ally as expiry nears.

If you look at Nifty **out-of-the-money (OTM)**, 25,200, 25,300, and 25,400 are strong resistance zones, with 25,250 being a particularly strong resistance level as the highest number of short positions are built at this strike price. In the deep **in-the-money (ITM)** range, fresh short positions have built up at 25,000, 24,900, and 24,800. Therefore, it will be difficult for Nifty to hold the 25,200–25,250 level.

If we analyze the put-side data, there is significant put writing at 25,000 on the **ATM**, and long positions have been closed deep **ITM,** which is a negative sign. If Nifty breaks the 25,000 level, the next biggest put writer zone is near 24,850.

Analyzing the call side data in Nifty, the call writers have built a strong fresh short position at the ATM 25,100 strike, with aggressive call writing at 25,200 and 25,300 strikes. It will be difficult for Nifty to move above 25,200 intraday.

If we analyze the data on the PUT side, a long position has been added in fresh PUTs at 25,100. This is a weak support zone, but the market stayed sideways near 25,100 throughout the day, and around 25,000 is the second largest PUT writer zone and serves as a strong support zone.

Today, Nifty is expected to move sideways in the range of 25,100 to 25,200, so forget about option buying. The chances of short covering or a rally in the market are quite low. Only if 25,100 breaks down might you see a small selling pressure, but that’s unlikely.

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"HDB Financial Services raises ₹3,369 Cr from anchor investors ahead of IPO — LIC leads the pack...!! HDB Financial Services, the non-banking arm of HDFC Bank, has raised ₹3,369 crore from 141 anchor investors ahead of its much-anticipated ₹12,500 crore IPO. This marks one of the largest pre-IPO anchor fundraises in the Indian NBFC space.

Key Highlights:

Price band: ₹695–740/share; anchor allotment at ₹740

Biggest anchor investor: LIC, investing ~₹220 crore

Other notable investors: BlackRock, Norges Bank, ICICI Pru, SBI MF, Kotak, Aditya Birla SL, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, etc.


Why it matters:

This is the largest IPO by a non-bank lender so far in 2025.

LIC’s participation is notable as it's rare for them to lead in private sector IPOs.

The IPO is priced conservatively—grey market premium (GMP) suggests a ~₹50–80 upside.

HDFC Bank is selling part of its 94% stake via OFS; ₹2,500 Cr is a fresh issue.


IPO Details:

Issue size: ₹12,500 crore

Open: June 25–27

Listing date (tentative): July 2

Reddit,dsm fresh ipo,"Why I Believe Ather Energy Will Be a Multibagger Hey Folks, I’ve been diving deep into Ather Energy since their IPO hit the scene in April 2025, and I’m convinced this EV two-wheeler (E2W) company has the potential to be a multibagger over the next 5-10 years. Here’s my take on why Ather could deliver massive returns for long-term investors. Buckle up, this is gonna be a detailed ride!


1. Riding the Electric Vehicle Megatrend in India  
India’s EV market is on fire, and Ather is perfectly positioned to capitalize. The Indian E2W market is projected to grow to 10–12 million units annually by FY31, driven by rising fuel costs, government incentives, and increasing environmental awareness. Ather, as the fourth-largest E2W manufacturer in India (behind Ola Electric, TVS, and Bajaj), already commands a 10.6% market share in FY24, with ambitions to hit 20% in the near term. 

Unlike traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) scooters, EVs offer lower running costs—think ₹600 in electricity vs. ₹5,200 in fuel for a petrol scooter over 80 km daily. Ather’s focus on premium, tech-laden scooters like the 450X and family-oriented Rizta appeals to both urban millennials and mass-market buyers, giving them a broad addressable market.

Why it matters: With government policies pushing for 30% EV penetration by 2030 and subsidies like FAME-III, Ather’s growth is backed by strong tailwinds. Their ability to scale volumes (42% YoY increase in FY25) shows they’re already gaining traction.


2. Innovation and Premium Positioning  
Ather isn’t just another EV maker—they’re the Apple of Indian E2Ws. Their scooters are packed with cutting-edge tech:  
- Smart features: Google Maps integration, multi-stop Trip Planner, Bluetooth connectivity, and Theft & Tow Alerts. 
- In-house R&D: With over 700 R&D employees and hundreds of patents, Ather designs critical components like motor controllers, dashboards, and battery packs in-house, ensuring quality and cost control.
- Ather Grid: They’ve built India’s largest EV two-wheeler fast-charging network, with 3,100+ charging points across 80+ cities, giving them a moat against competitors.

Their premium positioning sets them apart from budget players like Ola Electric, which often face quality complaints. Posts on X and Reddit rave about Ather’s build quality, ride experience, and service, with users calling it “the king in the south.” Ather’s ability to tap both the premium (450X, Apex) and mass-market (Rizta) segments gives them pricing power and scalability.

Why it matters: Ather’s tech-first approach and brand loyalty mirror companies like Tesla in their early days. As EVs become mainstream, their premium scooters will likely command higher margins, boosting profitability.

3. Financials Improving, Path to Profitability  
Yes, Ather is loss-making (₹1,059.7 Cr net loss in FY24), but the numbers tell a promising story.  
- Revenue growth: FY24 revenue was ₹1,789.1 Cr, and FY25 saw a 29% rise in total income.  
- Margin improvement: Adjusted Gross Margin doubled to 19% in FY25, and EBITDA margin improved from -34% to -23%. 
- Cost optimization: Ather’s new Rizta model has 7% lower Bill of Materials (BOM) costs, and their upcoming Factory 3.0 in Maharashtra will boost capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws annually, driving economies of scale. 

Their IPO proceeds (₹2,626 Cr fresh issue) will fund R&D, manufacturing expansion, and marketing, reducing reliance on external debt. Plus, their asset-light distribution model (third-party experience and service centers) keeps overheads low.

Why it matters: Multibaggers often start as loss-making companies with high growth potential. Ather’s improving margins and strategic investments mirror early-stage tech giants that turned profitable as they scaled.


4. Strong Backing and Market Confidence  
Ather’s investor lineup reads like a who’s who of Indian business:  
- Hero MotoCorp owns a 38%+ stake, providing industry expertise and financial muscle.
- Sachin Bansal (Flipkart founder) has poured in millions, signaling long-term confidence.
- NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund) invested $71M in 2024, pushing Ather to unicorn status ($1B valuation).  

Their IPO was a hit, with retail investors and institutions showing strong interest, despite some skepticism about the $2.5B valuation. Posts on X highlight Ather’s “impressive” scale and market share, reflecting positive sentiment.

Why it matters: Backing from heavyweights like Hero and NIIF reduces financial risk and signals Ather’s credibility. Hero’s distribution network could also supercharge Ather’s reach in Tier 2/3 cities.

5. Competitive Edge in a Crowded Market
The E2W space is heating up, with Ola Electric, TVS, Bajaj, and even Honda in the mix. But Ather has distinct advantages:  
- Quality over quantity: Unlike Ola, which faces criticism for poor quality and service, Ather’s scooters are praised for reliability and performance.  
- Niche focus: Ather targets urban, tech-savvy buyers and families, avoiding direct price wars with budget brands.  
- Charging infrastructure: Ather Grid’s 3,100+ fast chargers give them an edge over competitors with limited networks.

While reliance on imported components (e.g., from China) and government subsidies pose risks, Ather’s in-house manufacturing and vertical integration mitigate these.

Why it matters: In a competitive market, Ather’s focus on quality, tech, and infrastructure creates a defensible moat, positioning them to outpace rivals as the market consolidates.

Risks to Consider
No investment is a slam dunk, and Ather has challenges:  
- Profitability timeline: Losses may persist for a few years as they invest in growth.
- Competition: Ola’s aggressive pricing and Bajaj’s Chetak are formidable threats.  
- Valuation concerns: Some Reddit users called the IPO’s $2.5B valuation “frothy” compared to the $1.3B valuation in a pre-IPO round.
- External risks: Supply chain disruptions or changes in government subsidies could hurt margins. 

That said, multibaggers are rarely “safe” bets. The key is Ather’s ability to execute, and their track record—scaling to 109,577 units in FY24 and 107,983 in 9M FY25—shows they can deliver.


Why Ather Could Be a Multibagger
Multibaggers often share these traits: a growing market, innovative products, improving financials, and strong management. Ather checks all these boxes:  
- Market growth: India’s E2W market is set to explode, and Ather’s 10.6% share is just the start.  
- Innovation: Their tech and charging network set them apart.  
- Financial trajectory: Doubling gross margins and reducing losses show a clear path to profitability.  
- Leadership: Founders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain have built Ather from a startup to a unicorn, backed by industry giants.  

If Ather captures 20% market share by FY30 (as CEO Tarun Mehta targets) and turns profitable, their revenue could multiply, driving the stock price to 5x–10x returns. Compare this to early Tesla or even Indian multibaggers like Eicher Motors, which rode the premium two-wheeler wave.

My Strategy
I’m bullish on Ather for the long haul (5–10 years). I’ve allocated a small portion of my portfolio to their stock, treating it as a high-risk, high-reward bet. I’ll monitor their quarterly results, especially volume growth, margin expansion, and Factory 3.0’s progress. If the stock dips due to market volatility, I’ll consider averaging down, as EV stocks can be volatile in their early years.


TL;DR
Ather Energy is a premium EV two-wheeler maker with a 10.6% market share, strong innovation, and a growing charging network. Despite current losses, their 42% volume growth, doubling gross margins, and backing from Hero MotoCorp and NIIF make them a compelling long-term bet. With India’s E2W market set to boom, Ather has the potential to be a 5x–10x multibagger for patient investors.  

What do you folks think? Bullish on Ather, or are the risks too high? Let’s discuss! 👇

Reddit,sheel biotech ipo,"*How India 🇮🇳 is going to witness the Mother of all Bull Markets by 2035*? 
According to McKinsey, these 10 sectors are about to explode. 

Some by 6 to 10x in the next decade.

This is not just growth. 
This is history being written. 

Over the next few years.

India will add up to $5 trillion to its economy.

That’s like building another India inside the current one.

But this time it’s not just IT and outsourcing.

This time we’re building chips, rockets, energy and AI.

These 10 sectors are about to define India’s next decade.

👉 Sector 1 : EVs and Batteries (6 times growth)

India is already the third largest car market.

But electric vehicles are the next ₹40 lakh crore wave.

Tata, Ola and Mahindra are building the vehicles.

But the real money is in lithium, charging infra and battery recycling.

One startup here could power 10 cities.

👉 Sector 2 : AI Software and Services (5 times growth)

Every Indian IT firm is quietly turning into an AI firm.

Infosys, TCS and Zoho are just the tip.

The new wave? Indian AI tools for law, medicine, education and Bharat languages.

McKinsey says this space alone can add ₹16 lakh crore to India’s GDP.

👉 Sector 3 : E-commerce (4 times growth)

In 2014, India had 5 crore online shoppers.

In 2030, we’ll cross 60 crore.

And they won’t just be on Flipkart or Amazon.

They’ll shop through voice, WhatsApp, influencers and rural fintech.

The market is moving from English to Hinglish. From metros to mandis.

👉 Sector 4 : Semiconductors (3 times growth)

India is done being just the software guy.

Now we want to make the chip inside the device.

Tata, Vedanta and Micron are setting up fabs with up to 50 percent government support.

If this clicks, India won’t just be assembling iPhones. We’ll be designing their brains.

👉 Sector 5 : Space (4 times growth)

This is no longer just ISRO.

In 2023 alone, over 100 space startups emerged in India.

From launching satellites to building reusable rockets, India is now SpaceX at one-tenth the cost.

The global demand for low-cost launches is sky-high. And India is ready to supply.

👉 Sector 6 : Nuclear Fission (5 times growth)

Sounds futuristic. But the future is now.

India needs 24 times more clean energy by 2047.

Nuclear is compact, zero-carbon and reliable.

And new-age reactors like SMRs are being quietly explored by giants like Reliance.

👉 Sector 7 : Renewable Energy and Storage (3 times growth)

India aims for 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030.

But solar panels and windmills are useless without storage.

This is where battery parks, hydrogen and pumped hydro come in.

Storage is the backbone of the green revolution.

👉 Sector 8 : Bio-to-X Technologies (3 times growth)

India generates over 75 crore tonnes of biomass every year.

That’s not waste. That’s fuel, packaging, electricity and even jet fuel.

Startups are converting crop residue into high-value exports.

Biotech is not just pharma anymore. It’s bio-everything.

👉 Sector 9 : Biopharma (4 times growth)

India already supplies 60 percent of the world’s vaccines.

But now we want to invent them too. 

From AI-based drug discovery to high-end biologics, Indian pharma is going from generic to genius.

This sector alone could become bigger than the entire IT industry in a decade.

👉 Sector 10 : Cybersecurity (2.5 times growth)

In 2023, India faced over 9 lakh cyber attacks.

As UPI, healthtech and govtech scale, data threats will multiply.

India is already building its own digital fortress.

Startups are creating India-specific tools for detection, prevention and recovery.

These 10 sectors could generate over 10 crore jobs.

They will define our IPOs, our exports, our college degrees and even our politics.

The next 25 years won’t be services led. They’ll be innovation led. 

India is not just growing. 

It is transforming into the world’s biggest bull market.",1756034317.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1mysyk4/how_india_is_going_to_witness_the_mother_of_all/

1. IPO Party Continues: Dalal Street is buzzing with 21 new public issues and 26 companies set to debut. I'm watching these IPOs closely, as new listings often bring volatility and opportunities for short-term trades.

2. Market Correction Alert: HDFC Securities' Varun Lohchab suggests a potential 5–6% market correction due to global volatility. If volatility picks up, I may sell straddles to capitalize on market swings.

3. Stocks in Focus: Companies like Tata Motors, Waaree Energies, and HDFC Bank are in the spotlight. I'm thinking of going long on these stocks if they show strength, especially with Tata Motors' consistent performance.

4. Nifty 50 Changes: Max Healthcare and InterGlobe Aviation are set to join Nifty 50, with expected inflows of $1 billion. This could bring some bullish momentum to these stocks, and I might look at options strategies to play the potential upside.

5. Tata Capital's Valuation Trim: Tata Capital has trimmed its valuation to $15.7 billion ahead of its IPO launch. I'll be keeping an eye on this development, as it might affect market sentiment around financial services stocks.

* **Strong Fundamentals:** If the company has strong earnings growth, a competitive edge, and good future prospects, the high price may reflect positive expectations rather than excessive speculation.
* **Market Sentiment:** Sometimes stocks hit new highs because of positive news or industry trends, which can lead to further gains.
* **Trend Momentum:** In a strong uptrend, buying at new highs can be profitable as momentum drives prices higher.

However, risks include overvaluation, the stock might be overpriced compared to its intrinsic value, increasing the chance of a correction. Another risk is profit taking, some investors might sell at all time highs, causing short-term volatility.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Why I Believe Ather Energy Will Be a Multibagger Hey Folks, I’ve been diving deep into Ather Energy since their IPO hit the scene in April 2025, and I’m convinced this EV two-wheeler (E2W) company has the potential to be a multibagger over the next 5-10 years. Here’s my take on why Ather could deliver massive returns for long-term investors. Buckle up, this is gonna be a detailed ride!


1. Riding the Electric Vehicle Megatrend in India  
India’s EV market is on fire, and Ather is perfectly positioned to capitalize. The Indian E2W market is projected to grow to 10–12 million units annually by FY31, driven by rising fuel costs, government incentives, and increasing environmental awareness. Ather, as the fourth-largest E2W manufacturer in India (behind Ola Electric, TVS, and Bajaj), already commands a 10.6% market share in FY24, with ambitions to hit 20% in the near term. 

Unlike traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) scooters, EVs offer lower running costs—think ₹600 in electricity vs. ₹5,200 in fuel for a petrol scooter over 80 km daily. Ather’s focus on premium, tech-laden scooters like the 450X and family-oriented Rizta appeals to both urban millennials and mass-market buyers, giving them a broad addressable market.

Why it matters: With government policies pushing for 30% EV penetration by 2030 and subsidies like FAME-III, Ather’s growth is backed by strong tailwinds. Their ability to scale volumes (42% YoY increase in FY25) shows they’re already gaining traction.


2. Innovation and Premium Positioning  
Ather isn’t just another EV maker—they’re the Apple of Indian E2Ws. Their scooters are packed with cutting-edge tech:  
- Smart features: Google Maps integration, multi-stop Trip Planner, Bluetooth connectivity, and Theft & Tow Alerts. 
- In-house R&D: With over 700 R&D employees and hundreds of patents, Ather designs critical components like motor controllers, dashboards, and battery packs in-house, ensuring quality and cost control.
- Ather Grid: They’ve built India’s largest EV two-wheeler fast-charging network, with 3,100+ charging points across 80+ cities, giving them a moat against competitors.

Their premium positioning sets them apart from budget players like Ola Electric, which often face quality complaints. Posts on X and Reddit rave about Ather’s build quality, ride experience, and service, with users calling it “the king in the south.” Ather’s ability to tap both the premium (450X, Apex) and mass-market (Rizta) segments gives them pricing power and scalability.

Why it matters: Ather’s tech-first approach and brand loyalty mirror companies like Tesla in their early days. As EVs become mainstream, their premium scooters will likely command higher margins, boosting profitability.

3. Financials Improving, Path to Profitability  
Yes, Ather is loss-making (₹1,059.7 Cr net loss in FY24), but the numbers tell a promising story.  
- Revenue growth: FY24 revenue was ₹1,789.1 Cr, and FY25 saw a 29% rise in total income.  
- Margin improvement: Adjusted Gross Margin doubled to 19% in FY25, and EBITDA margin improved from -34% to -23%. 
- Cost optimization: Ather’s new Rizta model has 7% lower Bill of Materials (BOM) costs, and their upcoming Factory 3.0 in Maharashtra will boost capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws annually, driving economies of scale. 

Their IPO proceeds (₹2,626 Cr fresh issue) will fund R&D, manufacturing expansion, and marketing, reducing reliance on external debt. Plus, their asset-light distribution model (third-party experience and service centers) keeps overheads low.

Why it matters: Multibaggers often start as loss-making companies with high growth potential. Ather’s improving margins and strategic investments mirror early-stage tech giants that turned profitable as they scaled.


4. Strong Backing and Market Confidence  
Ather’s investor lineup reads like a who’s who of Indian business:  
- Hero MotoCorp owns a 38%+ stake, providing industry expertise and financial muscle.
- Sachin Bansal (Flipkart founder) has poured in millions, signaling long-term confidence.
- NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund) invested $71M in 2024, pushing Ather to unicorn status ($1B valuation).  

Their IPO was a hit, with retail investors and institutions showing strong interest, despite some skepticism about the $2.5B valuation. Posts on X highlight Ather’s “impressive” scale and market share, reflecting positive sentiment.

Why it matters: Backing from heavyweights like Hero and NIIF reduces financial risk and signals Ather’s credibility. Hero’s distribution network could also supercharge Ather’s reach in Tier 2/3 cities.

5. Competitive Edge in a Crowded Market
The E2W space is heating up, with Ola Electric, TVS, Bajaj, and even Honda in the mix. But Ather has distinct advantages:  
- Quality over quantity: Unlike Ola, which faces criticism for poor quality and service, Ather’s scooters are praised for reliability and performance.  
- Niche focus: Ather targets urban, tech-savvy buyers and families, avoiding direct price wars with budget brands.  
- Charging infrastructure: Ather Grid’s 3,100+ fast chargers give them an edge over competitors with limited networks.

While reliance on imported components (e.g., from China) and government subsidies pose risks, Ather’s in-house manufacturing and vertical integration mitigate these.

Why it matters: In a competitive market, Ather’s focus on quality, tech, and infrastructure creates a defensible moat, positioning them to outpace rivals as the market consolidates.

Risks to Consider
No investment is a slam dunk, and Ather has challenges:  
- Profitability timeline: Losses may persist for a few years as they invest in growth.
- Competition: Ola’s aggressive pricing and Bajaj’s Chetak are formidable threats.  
- Valuation concerns: Some Reddit users called the IPO’s $2.5B valuation “frothy” compared to the $1.3B valuation in a pre-IPO round.
- External risks: Supply chain disruptions or changes in government subsidies could hurt margins. 

That said, multibaggers are rarely “safe” bets. The key is Ather’s ability to execute, and their track record—scaling to 109,577 units in FY24 and 107,983 in 9M FY25—shows they can deliver.


Why Ather Could Be a Multibagger
Multibaggers often share these traits: a growing market, innovative products, improving financials, and strong management. Ather checks all these boxes:  
- Market growth: India’s E2W market is set to explode, and Ather’s 10.6% share is just the start.  
- Innovation: Their tech and charging network set them apart.  
- Financial trajectory: Doubling gross margins and reducing losses show a clear path to profitability.  
- Leadership: Founders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain have built Ather from a startup to a unicorn, backed by industry giants.  

If Ather captures 20% market share by FY30 (as CEO Tarun Mehta targets) and turns profitable, their revenue could multiply, driving the stock price to 5x–10x returns. Compare this to early Tesla or even Indian multibaggers like Eicher Motors, which rode the premium two-wheeler wave.

My Strategy
I’m bullish on Ather for the long haul (5–10 years). I’ve allocated a small portion of my portfolio to their stock, treating it as a high-risk, high-reward bet. I’ll monitor their quarterly results, especially volume growth, margin expansion, and Factory 3.0’s progress. If the stock dips due to market volatility, I’ll consider averaging down, as EV stocks can be volatile in their early years.


TL;DR
Ather Energy is a premium EV two-wheeler maker with a 10.6% market share, strong innovation, and a growing charging network. Despite current losses, their 42% volume growth, doubling gross margins, and backing from Hero MotoCorp and NIIF make them a compelling long-term bet. With India’s E2W market set to boom, Ather has the potential to be a 5x–10x multibagger for patient investors.  

What do you folks think? Bullish on Ather, or are the risks too high? Let’s discuss! 👇

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Zomato is the Nvidia of India? At first I laughed... then I thought hard. So someone said recently that ""Zomato is the Nvidia of India.""

At first, I thought it was a joke — one is a food delivery app, the other powers the AI revolution with chips. But then I actually dug deeper, and now I can’t unsee the surprising parallels.

Let me explain why this might actually make sense:

1. Both are building invisible infrastructure

Nvidia builds the infrastructure for AI: GPUs, CUDA, Omniverse – it’s the hidden layer behind ChatGPT, self-driving, gaming, etc.

Zomato (and Blinkit + Hyperpure) is building India’s hyperlocal last-mile logistics infrastructure — kitchens, dark stores, cold chains, delivery fleets.

You don’t see it, but your lifestyle now depends on it.

2. Data is the real moat

Nvidia has a data advantage via deep integration into AI workflows.

Zomato collects insane amounts of real-time consumer and delivery data — from what food people want during rain in Pune, to demand spikes in Gurgaon at 11 PM, to which restaurant has better hygiene history.

Data → Optimization → Dominance.

3. Vertical Integration

Nvidia went from GPU to AI platform.

Zomato is going from delivery to grocery (Blinkit), restaurant supply (Hyperpure), dining out, ad-tech, and fintech.

This isn’t a “Swiggy vs Zomato” game anymore. It’s an infra play.

4.They’re not selling products. They’re platforms.

Nvidia enables startups and enterprises to run AI.

Zomato enables restaurants and merchants to grow, reach customers, and optimize backend supply.

They’re both ""rails"" for others to operate on.

5.Optionality is off the charts

Nvidia has optionality across AI, robotics, edge computing, metaverse.

Zomato is creating optionality across:

Urban consumption

Quick commerce

Restaurant tech SaaS

Payments (Eternal Pay?)

Maybe even health/fitness down the line?

It’s no longer just “a food delivery company.” That label is outdated.

6. Valuation = Belief in Future Infra

Nvidia’s sky-high valuation is because of the future it powers.

Zomato’s valuation isn’t about today's profits — it’s about controlling the infrastructure of tomorrow’s consumption economy.

If India’s urban class keeps growing + demanding 10-minute deliveries + personalized food experiences — Zomato becomes indispensable.


EDIT: Hey All ! Some folks disagreed with this Nvidia-Zomato analogy and that's fair. But I posted it to explore a deeper angle on how Zomato is building something much bigger than food delivery. If I have missed something or overshot it, i'd love to know where !!",1753680742.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1mb7xk2/zomato_is_the_nvidia_of_india_at_first_i_laughed/

Reddit,urban company ipo,"SEBI just made some pretty big changes to IPO rules in India and I’m trying to wrap my head around what this means for us as investors. The gist:

* If a company lists with a market cap above ₹5 trillion, it now needs to float only 2.5% shares instead of 5%.
* They’ve got up to 5–10 years to hit the 25% public shareholding rule (so promoters keep control longer).
* And foreign investors finally get a single-window clearance instead of endless paperwork.

On paper, this looks great — easier for companies to go public, less dilution, and more global money flowing in. But the flip side is that accountability gets stretched. Promoters can hold on to power for much longer, and we might see IPOs where the public has less real say for years.

Feels like a trade-off: we’ll probably get more blockbuster IPOs, but will investors actually benefit if governance takes a back seat?

Curious what others here think — is this smart policy to attract capital, or just a free pass for promoters to keep control?",1757760814.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1nfuirr/sebi_just_made_some_pretty_big_changes_to_ipo/

Reddit,urban company ipo,"Can anyone help me understand with LG IPO analysis? LG IPO is something to study for.

A company with leading position , having superior RoNW and Higher EPS then peers should generally command a premium valuation and not 38 - 42% discounted valuation. The fact that book runners are pricing it so conservatively despite QIB Demand is a question of Fact that they are deployng 5 Book managers itself says they are trying to garuntee a sucess and not monetize it. 



When you closely observe the IPO

1. The Outflow ratio is 117%, on top of it they have extracted ₹ 45,817Cr in last 2 years, which is more then the IPO ask i.e. ₹ 11,607 cr 

2. Parent Company's Global performance is struggling, the topline CAGR is 3% with collapsing margins, while Indian entity is growing at 28% PAT CAGR. This shows that parent entity is higly depenedn on Indian asset, On top of it  Indian entity contributes to 50% of LG Holdings dividend recieved from Electronics verticle.  

3. LG Holding lost the equity value by 76% , and Electronics value lost is by 36%. So it needs a desperate proof to show a new value creation to its Korean Investors, and best way to create value addition is to tap and use capital market bull runs in india. there fore i assuem they wanted a 100% sucess in this IPO just to balance LG Holding equity value creation for Korean investors. 



This are my assumptions based on the filed DHRP reports, but i am sure many news and other outlets have more insider informations then me. Then why didnt anyone covered this aspects?



This IPO narrative is created as under valued listing which it definetely is, but if you look from LG holdings / LG Electronics INC (Parent company) its clearly a distress sale with value creation as their main motive.

Final verdict: high-risk, speculative play

📉 The company is still loss-making (₹14.14 crore loss in Q1 FY26) but revenue grew 19%.
📈 The IPO is an Offer for Sale (OFS), so no fresh capital for growth.

Reddit,urban company ipo,"[IPO Analysis] EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd. Hey folks,

I started [helloquant ](https://helloquant.in/)as a side project. Will talk about it later in details. One thing I realized is for IPO, there is no good website which is clean and give analysis in a straight forward manner. So, we are starting an IPO Analysis Series where we look at upcoming Indian IPOs through a **quantitative lens** — no fluff, just data, valuations, risks, and context.

Our first breakdown is on **EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd.** (incorp 1999), a company in the business of pre-engineered steel buildings and prefabricated structures. They also manufacture EPS (thermocol) blocks, sheets, and packaging products.

# 📌 IPO Details

* **Price Band**: ₹194–204
* **Issue Size**: ₹504 Cr (Fresh ₹300 Cr + OFS ₹204 Cr)
* **Current GMP**: \~₹20
* **Use of Proceeds**: Capex, working capital, debt repayment

# 📊 Financial Highlights

* Revenue CAGR: **31.4%** (highest among peers)
* PAT growth: **57%**
* ROE: **22.69%** | ROCE: **22.88%**
* EBITDA Margin: **10%+**

# 🔎 Valuation vs Peers

Peers: PENIND, INTERARCH, EVERESTIND, BEARDSELL

* **P/E** = 34.54 (rich vs peers)
* **ROE** = 22.7% (highest among peers)
* **WC Days** = 35 (very efficient)

# 🧮 Strengths

* Strong presence in a growing prefab construction market
* Diversified product mix (buildings + EPS)
* Expanding capacity with IPO proceeds
* Fastest revenue growth among peers

# ⚓ Anchors & Analyst Views

* Anchor investors include **WhiteOak, 360One, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley**
* Positive recommendations from **Reliance Securities, SBI Securities**

# ⚠️ Risks

* Volatility in raw material prices (steel dependency)
* Execution risks in expansion
* Competition from larger, established players

# 💡 Our Take

At the upper band, valuations look **expensive on P/E basis**, but strong ROE, efficient working capital, and anchor participation show confidence. Might be interesting for listing gains, but medium/long-term depends on execution.

2. Birla Corporation shares are in focus after their subsidiary became the preferred bidder for a mining block in Telangana. This is quite bullish for the company as it could improve their revenue stream. I'm considering a long position if the stock shows strength.

3. Jaro Education IPO is opening shortly for subscription with details on price band and GMP. IPOs can be quite volatile, but they also offer great opportunities for quick gains. I might look into this one for a short-term play.

4. Indian markets are expected to open weak as Gift Nifty trades marginally lower. This sets a cautious tone for the day. I may sell straddles if volatility stays high, looking for premium decay.

I’m 27 years old, single, and living in India. I currently take home around ₹1.3 lakhs per month post-tax. I've been investing since 2021, but I still consider myself a casual investor.

I want to invest ₹50K–₹60K/month for long-term wealth building. I'm looking for advice on:

* Which SIPs or portfolios seem redundant or unnecessary
* How I can better diversify across large/mid/small caps and debt
* Striking the right balance between safety and growth
* Tax efficiency: I follow the new tax regime, but how do I manage LTCG better?
* Whether my current global exposure (via INDmoney) is enough or should be improved
* Any personal finance advice you might have for me (can be other than investments as well).

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"Tomorrow Market Prediction: Market Recap, Levels & Strategies for September 24, 2025 Hello and welcome back to Replete Equities! If trading or investing in the Indian stock market is your game, then this update is for you. We’re breaking down today’s market action and what it means for tomorrow, September 24, 2025. From Nifty and Bank Nifty key levels to option market insights and fresh news, here’s everything you need to approach tomorrow’s trading with confidence.

1. Market Recap: September 23, 2025 – A Day of Consolidation and Caution

Nifty 50 slipped slightly, closing down 32.85 points (−0.13%) at 25,169.50. The trading range for the day was between 25,246.25 and 25,085—reflecting a cautious market that failed to hold onto early gains. Midcap and smallcap indices followed suit, edging lower by about half a percent.

Bank Nifty saw similar cautious sentiment, closing modestly lower at 55,248.70, with intraday swings between 55,624 and 55,143.

In terms of sector performance, banking and metals showed resilience and helped contain downside pressure, while FMCG stocks faced some selling. Big movers on the upside were IndusInd Bank, JSW Steel, Axis Bank, and Bajaj Finance. On the downside, weaker stocks included Trent, Tech Mahindra, SBI Life, UltraTech Cement, and HUL.

The overall market breadth remained negative, confirming a day of profit-booking and sideways movement.

2. Key Support & Resistance Levels to Watch Tomorrow:

Knowing where the market might find footing or hit a wall helps you position better. Here’s the precise outlook for both key indices:

Nifty 50:

I. Support: 25,100 (immediate), followed by 25,060–25,030 zone. The broader 24,900 to 25,000 zone remains a critical medium-term safety net.
II. Resistance: 25,200–25,250 in the short term, then 25,400, which has strong call option writing confirming resistance in this band.

Nifty is under pressure but holding above crucial support, indicating potential for consolidation or mild recovery if 25,100 holds firm.

Bank Nifty:

I. Support: 55,100 first line of defense; if broken, watch next at 55,000.
II. Resistance: 55,500–55,600, then 56,000 on a strong breakout.

Bank Nifty’s near-term moves will be highly dependent on these key pivot points. A move above resistance levels could signal fresh bullish momentum, while a break down may intensify caution.

3. Option Chain Insights: What the Market’s Big Players are Signaling;

The option chain data reveals market expectations and potential volatility zones:

Nifty: The heaviest call open interest clusters around the 25,400–25,500 strikes, marking strong resistance caps. Conversely, put open interest peaks at 25,100 and 25,000 provide vital support levels. Interesting to note is substantial option writing at the 25,200 strike on both calls and puts, suggesting the market anticipates rangebound movement near that level unless influenced by substantial news. The put-call ratio (PCR) is balanced, showing no dominant bias at this point.

Bank Nifty: Peaks in open interest appear at 55,000 (put side – support) and 56, 000 (call side – resistance). This indicates anticipated consolidation and potential for sharp moves only if these critical levels are decisively broken. With the weekly expiry approaching soon, expect these pivots to be key decision zones for traders.


4. Key News and Market Triggers for Tomorrow:

I. Global cues remain mixed. Asian markets showed some pressure while US markets remained steady, adding layers of uncertainty for Indian markets. Crude oil and currency movements continue to keep traders on toes.

II. IPO happenings: The Ganesh Consumer Products IPO continues but with muted subscriber interest. Its performance over the coming days remains a point of attention for market participants.

III. No impactful bulk deals or major policy announcements were seen today, keeping the market mostly driven by sector-specific and global cues.
What’s the Sentiment? Trading Advice for Tomorrow

5. The tone is cautious and slightly negative. Here’s what to keep in mind:

I. For Nifty, maintain a neutral to mildly bearish stance between 25,050 and 25,250.
Buyers should consider entering near the lower support zones (around 25,100), but keep tight stops if prices drop below 25,000.

II. For Bank Nifty, bulls should look for a clear breakout above 55,500 before committing more capital. Falling below 55,000 should raise alarm bells and encourage risk reduction.

III. Sector wise, tread carefully, especially avoiding IT stocks, which face headwinds related to US H-1B visa fee hikes. Consumption and industrials may offer better relative strength in this phase.

IV. Volatility indexes are elevated — adopting spread strategies picking rangebound moves is a safer bet than outright directional bets.

Overall, expect choppy, range-bound trading until fresh catalysts emerge. Play the range and be ready for quick exits.

6. Final Thoughts: Stay Prepared, Stay Nimble

Markets are showing more resistance to upside moves but aren’t ready for a full turnaround either. The best approach for tomorrow is to remain nimble, keep stops close, and watch those technical levels closely. Volatility remains your friend if you trade smartly, and risk management will be your best ally as expiry nears.

Reddit,jsw cement ipo,"Automation Boosts Consistency in Indian Stock Market Trading Hey guys, I have curated some news articles for my trading setup today. Here are some interesting developments:

1. Premier Energies and JSW Holdings are among six stocks currently showing a bullish RSI upswing. I'm looking at these for potential entries if the bullish momentum sustains.

2. Nazara Technologies is approaching its record date for a 1:1 bonus issue and a 1:2 stock split. This could increase liquidity and attract more retail investors; I'm considering a closer analysis to see if it aligns with my algo setups.

3. Quest Global might sell up to 6% of its holdings to raise over $200 million. Such moves often influence market sentiment, and I might short if there's a significant dip post-announcement.

4. Jinkushal Industries has secured Rs 35 crore from anchor investors ahead of its IPO. IPOs can be volatile, but they also offer opportunities; I'll be watching this one to see how it performs.

5. TruAlt Bioenergy has raised Rs 252 crore via anchor book ahead of its IPO. Similar to Jinkushal, this could be an opportunity for a quick trade depending on the initial market response.

I use daily news to scan potential stocks, and if they fall into my algo setups, I take the trade. Curious if anyone else does this.",1758771939.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1npwoun/automation_boosts_consistency_in_indian_stock/

In many cases, this momentum fades in the following sessions as traders book profits. However, if the uptrend is backed by strong fundamentals or continued positive triggers, the stock can sustain its upward trend.

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"*How India 🇮🇳 is going to witness the Mother of all Bull Markets by 2035*? 
According to McKinsey, these 10 sectors are about to explode. 

Some by 6 to 10x in the next decade.

This is not just growth. 
This is history being written. 

Over the next few years.

India will add up to $5 trillion to its economy.

That’s like building another India inside the current one.

But this time it’s not just IT and outsourcing.

This time we’re building chips, rockets, energy and AI.

These 10 sectors are about to define India’s next decade.

👉 Sector 1 : EVs and Batteries (6 times growth)

India is already the third largest car market.

But electric vehicles are the next ₹40 lakh crore wave.

Tata, Ola and Mahindra are building the vehicles.

But the real money is in lithium, charging infra and battery recycling.

One startup here could power 10 cities.

👉 Sector 2 : AI Software and Services (5 times growth)

Every Indian IT firm is quietly turning into an AI firm.

Infosys, TCS and Zoho are just the tip.

The new wave? Indian AI tools for law, medicine, education and Bharat languages.

McKinsey says this space alone can add ₹16 lakh crore to India’s GDP.

👉 Sector 3 : E-commerce (4 times growth)

In 2014, India had 5 crore online shoppers.

In 2030, we’ll cross 60 crore.

And they won’t just be on Flipkart or Amazon.

They’ll shop through voice, WhatsApp, influencers and rural fintech.

The market is moving from English to Hinglish. From metros to mandis.

👉 Sector 4 : Semiconductors (3 times growth)

India is done being just the software guy.

Now we want to make the chip inside the device.

Tata, Vedanta and Micron are setting up fabs with up to 50 percent government support.

If this clicks, India won’t just be assembling iPhones. We’ll be designing their brains.

👉 Sector 5 : Space (4 times growth)

This is no longer just ISRO.

In 2023 alone, over 100 space startups emerged in India.

From launching satellites to building reusable rockets, India is now SpaceX at one-tenth the cost.

The global demand for low-cost launches is sky-high. And India is ready to supply.

👉 Sector 6 : Nuclear Fission (5 times growth)

Sounds futuristic. But the future is now.

India needs 24 times more clean energy by 2047.

Nuclear is compact, zero-carbon and reliable.

And new-age reactors like SMRs are being quietly explored by giants like Reliance.

👉 Sector 7 : Renewable Energy and Storage (3 times growth)

India aims for 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030.

But solar panels and windmills are useless without storage.

This is where battery parks, hydrogen and pumped hydro come in.

Storage is the backbone of the green revolution.

👉 Sector 8 : Bio-to-X Technologies (3 times growth)

India generates over 75 crore tonnes of biomass every year.

That’s not waste. That’s fuel, packaging, electricity and even jet fuel.

Startups are converting crop residue into high-value exports.

Biotech is not just pharma anymore. It’s bio-everything.

👉 Sector 9 : Biopharma (4 times growth)

India already supplies 60 percent of the world’s vaccines.

But now we want to invent them too. 

From AI-based drug discovery to high-end biologics, Indian pharma is going from generic to genius.

This sector alone could become bigger than the entire IT industry in a decade.

👉 Sector 10 : Cybersecurity (2.5 times growth)

In 2023, India faced over 9 lakh cyber attacks.

As UPI, healthtech and govtech scale, data threats will multiply.

India is already building its own digital fortress.

Startups are creating India-specific tools for detection, prevention and recovery.

These 10 sectors could generate over 10 crore jobs.

They will define our IPOs, our exports, our college degrees and even our politics.

The next 25 years won’t be services led. They’ll be innovation led. 

India is not just growing. 

It is transforming into the world’s biggest bull market.",1756034317.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1mysyk4/how_india_is_going_to_witness_the_mother_of_all/

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024^ We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

**Risk Disclosure for Investing in Unlisted Shares:**

Investing in unlisted shares involves significant risks, including but not limited to the following:

1. **Liquidity Risk**: Unlisted shares may not have an active secondary market, making it difficult to sell or exit the investment quickly.
2. **Valuation Risk**: Pricing of unlisted shares can be subjective due to the lack of transparent market valuations.
3. **Business Risk**: These shares are often of companies in early or growth stages, which may experience high volatility and risk of failure.
4. **Regulatory Risk**: Unlisted companies may not be subject to the same regulatory and disclosure requirements as listed firms, increasing the risk of insufficient information.
5. **Long-Term Investment**: Unlisted shares may require a longer investment horizon with no guaranteed exit or return on investment.
6. **Dilution Risk**: Future capital raises may dilute your ownership stake if you are unable to participate.",1726813030.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1fl5gcz/unlisted_shares_available/

Reddit,vikram solar ipo,"Hold or sell? Nerves of steel. Planning to hold this till oct. Any thoughts? It will either be the best decision of my life or the worst. 

Here is my analysis and reason for holding: 
1) Company in great sector solar panels and solar pumps.
2) Company is a competitor with shakti pump, having similar clients. Shakti pumps has give a phenomenal result with 5x sales YoY.. so I am thinking a similar trajectory as both these peer have similar clients.
3) listed at a PE of 30.. which is half of the industry average at 60. 
4) This year we had many SME solar based ipos and most of them are over 300-500% from their IPO price. 
5) The company itself is growing its profits and sales with great ROE 53% and RoCE 39%
6) Govt clients have 72% pf revenue split.
7) Gove push to clean energy and push in solar sector.
8) Company has 100MW production capacity but only using 25% utilization. The scope for scale is huge here. 

Though its not that easy as company has some risks as well :
1) Debt js high for its size. D/E ratio of 1.7 
2) 70% business from Solar pumps where shakti pump is a huge competitor.
3) High client concentration as 67% revenue is from top 10 clients.",1722263043.0,3,https://i.redd.it/shl54ai9wgfd1.jpeg

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"How IPOs makes fool to the retailers. Mostly I recommend people to always sell the ipo just a after it get listed. After listed gain there will not be more left in the companies. 

Take recent ipo of sula vineyard, dreamfolks etc


Most of the companies really think retailers are fool and they many making machines. 

First they increase their ebita margins and wait for right time when market is up and bring their ipo. This way they tell the people we are just bringing our ipo at fair valuation at PE of 30 which according to market. 

They don't tell you they had increase their margins hence their profits seems to be 60-70% extra in their profit loss statement. You are not buying at PE of 30 their shares. Actually you are buying 50-55 PE in real terms if you remove their inflated profits. 

Take example of Mama Earth. That fucking company owner itself has crores of money but they want money of retail small investors by doing fake things. No one going probe them. 

They sold their products huge to distributor before IPO just to show the profit of the company and take money at higher prices from investors. 

I still think if anyone having 10-15 cr he can live best of his life but why they want more money by doing fake things. They can still earn money by doing good business. 

Look at sula vineyard people made it famous and now look their ebita margins fallen from 32-35% to 25-26%. Itself deeps the profits by 25-26%.

Look. At dreamfolks they bought ipo at 13% now the margins are just 7%.
Half of the margins. Promotor of the company sold her shares in IPO and she again selling her shares every quarter

She already knows margins going to go down hence this will be best time to. Invest. 

But she never going to tell on IPO day that further margins not going to sustain or drop from here. 


My suggestion to all the people is don't even try to burn you hands in IPO. Personally I never applied in my to any IPO. 

Best is there are 100s of company which are trusted better growth and getting at lower valuation then why you wants to burn your hands in IPO. Or after IPO in these stocks. 


If you are normal investor wants to earn 16-18% then just buy 10 large cap which are growing by 13-15% their sales. 

Example:- Bajaj finance, pidilite, ITC, Sanofi, SKf India, maruti, mahindra 

Even if you take position in this stock right now s you are going to make 14% with 1.3% of avg dividend. Thats total return will come at 15%. That very decent return. People don't understand without doing anything you are getting 15% return on your money. 

The people who are in mutual fund then that too are best but only things is you needs to learn how to fund good mutual funds and how to diversify them

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Tata Capital share price opens modestly. What does this mean for NBFC IPO valuations? Tata Capital share price listed at ₹330, just one percent above its IPO price of ₹326, which feels modest compared with some of the high-profile listings earlier this year. The IPO raised ₹15,511 crore and was subscribed 1.95 times, with large investors taking the majority of the allocation while retail interest stayed low. The grey market was flat before listing.

Analysts note that Tata Capital is aiming to bring its credit cost below one percent by improving underwriting, which could make the stock story more attractive if successful. What valuation metrics would you use for an NBFC now, whether price to earnings, price to book, or return on assets? Does this muted Tata Capital share price give a chance to invest in a steady franchise or is it a sign to be cautious with new NBFC IPOs?

1. Premier Energies and JSW Holdings are among six stocks currently showing a bullish RSI upswing. I'm looking at these for potential entries if the bullish momentum sustains.

2. Nazara Technologies is approaching its record date for a 1:1 bonus issue and a 1:2 stock split. This could increase liquidity and attract more retail investors; I'm considering a closer analysis to see if it aligns with my algo setups.

3. Quest Global might sell up to 6% of its holdings to raise over $200 million. Such moves often influence market sentiment, and I might short if there's a significant dip post-announcement.

4. Jinkushal Industries has secured Rs 35 crore from anchor investors ahead of its IPO. IPOs can be volatile, but they also offer opportunities; I'll be watching this one to see how it performs.

5. TruAlt Bioenergy has raised Rs 252 crore via anchor book ahead of its IPO. Similar to Jinkushal, this could be an opportunity for a quick trade depending on the initial market response.

I use daily news to scan potential stocks, and if they fall into my algo setups, I take the trade. Curious if anyone else does this.",1758771939.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1npwoun/automation_boosts_consistency_in_indian_stock/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Ola Electric: From Market Leader to Meltdown? Ola Electric’s market cap is still hovering around ₹22,000–23,000 crore, but the fundamentals just don’t justify it right now. The stock has tanked nearly 50% in the last six months and is trading at ₹50–51, way below its IPO price of ₹76 and miles off its all-time high of ₹157. The recent 3.2% equity block deal (worth ₹731 crore) only added to the selling pressure, with the stock dropping another 7% in a day.

Here’s why I think it’s time to exit:

* **Widening Losses:** Q4 FY25 net loss ballooned to ₹870 crore (vs ₹416 crore last year), and annual losses for FY25 hit ₹2,276 crore. Revenue collapsed 59% YoY last quarter to just ₹611 crore, and full-year revenue is down too.
* **Falling Sales:** Vehicle registrations dropped over 52% YoY last quarter. Deliveries nearly halved. This isn’t just seasonality—TVS and Bajaj have overtaken Ola in monthly EV sales.
* **No Profit in Sight:** Management is promising profitability in FY26, but brokerages aren’t convinced. Kotak has slashed its target to ₹30 (another 40% downside from here), citing ongoing EBITDA losses, weak brand equity, and tough competition. Even the most optimistic brokerages have targets below the IPO price.
* **Technical Weakness:** The stock is trading below almost all key moving averages (5, 10, 100, 150, 200-day SMAs)—clear bearish signals.
* **Execution Risks:** The company’s big bet on motorcycles and cell manufacturing is still unproven. Battery yields are stuck at 63% and need to cross 80% before they can even use them in their own vehicles.
* **Better Alternatives:** Analysts are openly recommending switching to other EV plays or established auto stocks. The sector is getting crowded, and legacy players are ramping up fast.

**Retail investors** should be extra careful here: 

* Ola Electric’s market share has plunged from 49% to under 19% in just six months.
* ICRA recently downgraded its credit rating to BBB+ (Negative) due to ongoing losses and missed government incentive targets.
* The stock has dropped over 50% from its peak value.
* The company is under regulatory scrutiny and has initiated mass layoffs.
* Ola Electric receives over 80,000 customer complaints per month, signaling deeper operational issues.

**Bottom line**: The market cap is still way too high for a company with shrinking sales, ballooning losses, and no clear path to profit. Unless you’re betting on a miracle turnaround, there are safer and better bets in the EV/auto space right now. If it breaks below ₹45, the technicals could get even uglier.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"HDFC Bank Q1 FY26 Earnings - My observation & perspective The quarter was marked by strong deposit growth and improved operational efficiency, but was weighed down by elevated provisions, sequential NPA deterioration, and continued pressure on margins.

The bank’s total income grew 13.7% YoY to ₹1.33 lakh crore, supported by healthy deposit accretion. However, NII growth moderated to 7.3% YoY, while PAT declined 1.3% YoY to ₹16,258 crore, and fell 13.7% sequentially. The core issue is a massive spike in provisions to ₹15,314 crore (vs ₹3,143 crore YoY), largely on account of floating provisions funded by gains from the HDB Financial IPO. Loan growth came in muted at 7% YoY, trailing deposit growth of 16%.

Gross NPAs rose to 1.40% and Net NPAs to 0.47%. The absolute GNPA figure stood at ₹37,041 crore, marking a sequential increase of ₹1,800 crore. While asset quality slippage warrants attention, HDFC Bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio remains strong at 19.88%, a rise of 108 bps YoY, comfortably above regulatory thresholds. The bank is clearly preparing for potential stress, front-loading provisions to de-risk future quarters.

NIMs dropped to \~3.56%, continuing a downward trajectory (3.69% in Q1 FY25, 3.62% in Q4 FY25). This shows faster loan repricing post-RBI’s 100 bps rate cuts, squeezing spreads. On a brighter note, the Cost-to-Income Ratio improved to 37%, down 280 bps YoY.

The Treasury division surprised with a 70% YoY jump in income, buoyed by favorable bond market conditions. Retail Banking maintained solid momentum (+10.5% YoY), while Wholesale Banking slipped 5%, on account of muted corporate credit demand. The insurance segment grew 6.7%, contributing steadily to the bottom line.

Among the negatives are rising NPAs, ongoing margin compression, and a visible decline in profitability. Even after adjusting for floating provisions, underlying credit costs remain elevated.

That said, there are clear positives, like the bank’s deposit franchise continues to shine, with 16% YoY growth. The loan-to-deposit ratio normalized to 99.2% (from 107.6% last year), improving structural liquidity. Use of HDB IPO gains for provisioning is a prudent long-term move. Operational efficiency metrics are also trending in the right direction.

HDFC Bank is playing the long game, but investors must watch asset quality trends closely over the next few quarters.

In a market that rewards the flashy, HDFC Bank is doing the hard, unsexy work of building resilience.",1752919734.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1m3snc3/hdfc_bank_q1_fy26_earnings_my_observation/

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"You won’t find these stocks on Zerodha and there is a good reason for that. Over the past few years, I have noticed a growing buzz around a high-risk asset class: unlisted shares.

And no, I’m not talking about early stage startups like Zepto.

I am referring to established names like:

* NSE (National Stock Exchange) - up nearly 30% YoY in the unlisted space
* Tata Capital - gaining solid investor interest

But before you get carried away, let me be clear, this is not meant for retail investors.

Unlisted shares are highly risky and illiquid. They're typically suited for HNIs and UHNIs who have access to deep networks, extensive due diligence, and the financial muscle to handle potential losses.

Here are two key red flags to watch out for:

* Lack of liquidity - You might not find a buyer when you want to sell
* [Post-IPO](https://web.stockedge.com/ipo?section=listed-ipo) lock-in - Even after listing, there's a 6-month lock-in period for unlisted investors

Unless you are well-informed and financially resilient, the risks in unlisted shares can far outweigh the potential rewards.

AAA-rated NBFC

✅ SWOT Analysis:

Strengths

 ✔ Backed by HDFC Bank

 ✔ Diversified retail/MSME loan portfolio

 ✔ Wide presence in Tier 2/3 cities

Weaknesses

 ⚠ High exposure to unsecured and SME loans

 ⚠ Slower RoA vs peers (\~2.6%)

Opportunities

🌐 Rising digital lending in Bharat

 💼 IPO listing could unlock growth capital

 🤝 Cross-selling via HDFC ecosystem

Threats

📉 Fintech disruption

🔍 RBI regulations on NBFCs

📊 Credit cycle & NPA risks

💰 Valuation Talk:

IPO price band: ₹700–740

Grey market premium: Once 70%, now settled around 10–12%

Implied P/B: 4.6× at ₹1,240 (unlisted), vs Bajaj Finance at \~3.8×

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"PhonePe Initiates IPO Preparations, Eyes $15 Billion Valuation. PhonePe, India’s preeminent digital payments platform, has formally commenced groundwork for its forthcoming initial public offering (IPO), in a move that underscores the accelerating maturation of the country's fintech sector. According to sources cited by PTI, the company has engaged four prominent global investment banks—Kotak Mahindra Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley—to advise on and underwrite the offering.

Currently valued at approximately $12 billion, PhonePe is reportedly aiming to raise $1.5 billion through the IPO, a capital influx that could elevate its valuation to around $15 billion. The proposed listing marks a significant milestone not only for the company but also for India’s broader digital economy, which has seen rapid expansion on the back of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) framework.

The company is expected to file its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) by August, with the public listing anticipated before the close of the calendar year.

This development arrives amid a global recalibration of tech valuations and investor sentiment, yet reflects continued confidence in the growth trajectory of Indian digital finance infrastructure. PhonePe's market leadership in UPI transactions and diversified financial services portfolio position it favorably to capitalize on both domestic retail participation and institutional interest.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"HDB Financial Services raises ₹3,369 Cr from anchor investors ahead of IPO — LIC leads the pack...!! HDB Financial Services, the non-banking arm of HDFC Bank, has raised ₹3,369 crore from 141 anchor investors ahead of its much-anticipated ₹12,500 crore IPO. This marks one of the largest pre-IPO anchor fundraises in the Indian NBFC space.

Key Highlights:

Price band: ₹695–740/share; anchor allotment at ₹740

Biggest anchor investor: LIC, investing ~₹220 crore

Other notable investors: BlackRock, Norges Bank, ICICI Pru, SBI MF, Kotak, Aditya Birla SL, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, etc.


Why it matters:

This is the largest IPO by a non-bank lender so far in 2025.

LIC’s participation is notable as it's rare for them to lead in private sector IPOs.

The IPO is priced conservatively—grey market premium (GMP) suggests a ~₹50–80 upside.

HDFC Bank is selling part of its 94% stake via OFS; ₹2,500 Cr is a fresh issue.


IPO Details:

Issue size: ₹12,500 crore

Open: June 25–27

Listing date (tentative): July 2

Retail quota, HDFC Bank shareholder quota, and employee quota included

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Why I Believe Ather Energy Will Be a Multibagger Hey Folks, I’ve been diving deep into Ather Energy since their IPO hit the scene in April 2025, and I’m convinced this EV two-wheeler (E2W) company has the potential to be a multibagger over the next 5-10 years. Here’s my take on why Ather could deliver massive returns for long-term investors. Buckle up, this is gonna be a detailed ride!


1. Riding the Electric Vehicle Megatrend in India  
India’s EV market is on fire, and Ather is perfectly positioned to capitalize. The Indian E2W market is projected to grow to 10–12 million units annually by FY31, driven by rising fuel costs, government incentives, and increasing environmental awareness. Ather, as the fourth-largest E2W manufacturer in India (behind Ola Electric, TVS, and Bajaj), already commands a 10.6% market share in FY24, with ambitions to hit 20% in the near term. 

Unlike traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) scooters, EVs offer lower running costs—think ₹600 in electricity vs. ₹5,200 in fuel for a petrol scooter over 80 km daily. Ather’s focus on premium, tech-laden scooters like the 450X and family-oriented Rizta appeals to both urban millennials and mass-market buyers, giving them a broad addressable market.

Why it matters: With government policies pushing for 30% EV penetration by 2030 and subsidies like FAME-III, Ather’s growth is backed by strong tailwinds. Their ability to scale volumes (42% YoY increase in FY25) shows they’re already gaining traction.


2. Innovation and Premium Positioning  
Ather isn’t just another EV maker—they’re the Apple of Indian E2Ws. Their scooters are packed with cutting-edge tech:  
- Smart features: Google Maps integration, multi-stop Trip Planner, Bluetooth connectivity, and Theft & Tow Alerts. 
- In-house R&D: With over 700 R&D employees and hundreds of patents, Ather designs critical components like motor controllers, dashboards, and battery packs in-house, ensuring quality and cost control.
- Ather Grid: They’ve built India’s largest EV two-wheeler fast-charging network, with 3,100+ charging points across 80+ cities, giving them a moat against competitors.

Their premium positioning sets them apart from budget players like Ola Electric, which often face quality complaints. Posts on X and Reddit rave about Ather’s build quality, ride experience, and service, with users calling it “the king in the south.” Ather’s ability to tap both the premium (450X, Apex) and mass-market (Rizta) segments gives them pricing power and scalability.

Why it matters: Ather’s tech-first approach and brand loyalty mirror companies like Tesla in their early days. As EVs become mainstream, their premium scooters will likely command higher margins, boosting profitability.

3. Financials Improving, Path to Profitability  
Yes, Ather is loss-making (₹1,059.7 Cr net loss in FY24), but the numbers tell a promising story.  
- Revenue growth: FY24 revenue was ₹1,789.1 Cr, and FY25 saw a 29% rise in total income.  
- Margin improvement: Adjusted Gross Margin doubled to 19% in FY25, and EBITDA margin improved from -34% to -23%. 
- Cost optimization: Ather’s new Rizta model has 7% lower Bill of Materials (BOM) costs, and their upcoming Factory 3.0 in Maharashtra will boost capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws annually, driving economies of scale. 

Their IPO proceeds (₹2,626 Cr fresh issue) will fund R&D, manufacturing expansion, and marketing, reducing reliance on external debt. Plus, their asset-light distribution model (third-party experience and service centers) keeps overheads low.

Why it matters: Multibaggers often start as loss-making companies with high growth potential. Ather’s improving margins and strategic investments mirror early-stage tech giants that turned profitable as they scaled.


4. Strong Backing and Market Confidence  
Ather’s investor lineup reads like a who’s who of Indian business:  
- Hero MotoCorp owns a 38%+ stake, providing industry expertise and financial muscle.
- Sachin Bansal (Flipkart founder) has poured in millions, signaling long-term confidence.
- NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund) invested $71M in 2024, pushing Ather to unicorn status ($1B valuation).  

Their IPO was a hit, with retail investors and institutions showing strong interest, despite some skepticism about the $2.5B valuation. Posts on X highlight Ather’s “impressive” scale and market share, reflecting positive sentiment.

Why it matters: Backing from heavyweights like Hero and NIIF reduces financial risk and signals Ather’s credibility. Hero’s distribution network could also supercharge Ather’s reach in Tier 2/3 cities.

5. Competitive Edge in a Crowded Market
The E2W space is heating up, with Ola Electric, TVS, Bajaj, and even Honda in the mix. But Ather has distinct advantages:  
- Quality over quantity: Unlike Ola, which faces criticism for poor quality and service, Ather’s scooters are praised for reliability and performance.  
- Niche focus: Ather targets urban, tech-savvy buyers and families, avoiding direct price wars with budget brands.  
- Charging infrastructure: Ather Grid’s 3,100+ fast chargers give them an edge over competitors with limited networks.

While reliance on imported components (e.g., from China) and government subsidies pose risks, Ather’s in-house manufacturing and vertical integration mitigate these.

Why it matters: In a competitive market, Ather’s focus on quality, tech, and infrastructure creates a defensible moat, positioning them to outpace rivals as the market consolidates.

Risks to Consider
No investment is a slam dunk, and Ather has challenges:  
- Profitability timeline: Losses may persist for a few years as they invest in growth.
- Competition: Ola’s aggressive pricing and Bajaj’s Chetak are formidable threats.  
- Valuation concerns: Some Reddit users called the IPO’s $2.5B valuation “frothy” compared to the $1.3B valuation in a pre-IPO round.
- External risks: Supply chain disruptions or changes in government subsidies could hurt margins. 

That said, multibaggers are rarely “safe” bets. The key is Ather’s ability to execute, and their track record—scaling to 109,577 units in FY24 and 107,983 in 9M FY25—shows they can deliver.


Why Ather Could Be a Multibagger
Multibaggers often share these traits: a growing market, innovative products, improving financials, and strong management. Ather checks all these boxes:  
- Market growth: India’s E2W market is set to explode, and Ather’s 10.6% share is just the start.  
- Innovation: Their tech and charging network set them apart.  
- Financial trajectory: Doubling gross margins and reducing losses show a clear path to profitability.  
- Leadership: Founders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain have built Ather from a startup to a unicorn, backed by industry giants.  

If Ather captures 20% market share by FY30 (as CEO Tarun Mehta targets) and turns profitable, their revenue could multiply, driving the stock price to 5x–10x returns. Compare this to early Tesla or even Indian multibaggers like Eicher Motors, which rode the premium two-wheeler wave.

My Strategy
I’m bullish on Ather for the long haul (5–10 years). I’ve allocated a small portion of my portfolio to their stock, treating it as a high-risk, high-reward bet. I’ll monitor their quarterly results, especially volume growth, margin expansion, and Factory 3.0’s progress. If the stock dips due to market volatility, I’ll consider averaging down, as EV stocks can be volatile in their early years.


TL;DR
Ather Energy is a premium EV two-wheeler maker with a 10.6% market share, strong innovation, and a growing charging network. Despite current losses, their 42% volume growth, doubling gross margins, and backing from Hero MotoCorp and NIIF make them a compelling long-term bet. With India’s E2W market set to boom, Ather has the potential to be a 5x–10x multibagger for patient investors.  

What do you folks think? Bullish on Ather, or are the risks too high? Let’s discuss! 👇

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"Scams Chalre Beware So I got added to a group for ""Goldman Sachs Asset Management"" saying they'll help me with investment purposes. Now obviously I know it's a scam but I've seen my own sister lose 21 lakhs to this. And it's difficult to even get the money back cause they siphon it into and through different victims accounts. This means tumhare paise jaaenge toh jaaenge, agar kisine police case kara toh tumhare account mein aur paiso ki lein, ie, block lagg jaegi. (My sister currently has a block of 9 lakh rupees on top of the other 21 she lost.) 

So it's a situation where you can potentially lose all your life savings, as did my sister. 

I'll give you an idea of the MO, they'll give you stock ideas, they'll give you profits. This gains your trust. Usually it's two types of stocks, either stocks that have sureshot market predictions to raise or rally, ie, absolutely strong fundamentals. Or they'll give you stocks that are sooooo small that it's easy to manipulate and pump them with their scam money.

Once you see it working, you'll be given a golden opportunity to join their ""Institutional Investor Account"" which will be shown as the holy grail of investment. As per them, it's the secret of investing. This is how the big people make money in reality. It'll be either an apk or a fake website with a stock market interface designed into it. You'll add money to it, it'll show in it, and they'll allot shares and even IPO allotments to you. (Obviously it's not real, it's a fake interface and the money is going to their accounts) And then you'll make profits, but when you go onto withdraw profits, you'll be kicked out and lose all access to the accounts as well as their ""exclusive investor"" services.

Reddit,patel retail ipo,"DMart user tries Zepto  
I’ve been an investor in DMart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from DMart for many years to ensure we stay self-sustainable 😂. I tried Zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact DMart in the long run. Here are my two cents:

1. **Experience with Zepto**: It was really good and fast, and cheaper due to coupons, but not when compared to DMart's prices.

2. **Will I buy from Zepto again?**  
   Sure, I will. Who doesn’t want a few quick deals in the name of a discount?

3. **Will I continue investing in DMart or invest more?**  
   Yes, I will. Until quick commerce burns VC capital, I’ll stay invested. Once the business model is proven to fail, DMart will likely boom.

**How long can VCs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption?**  
Only until the IPO, or six months after the IPO due to the lock-in period.


**Updates:**

Most people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend Blinkit:

**Usability of the application:**


**1. Once people become accustomed to an app, they are unlikely to switch, even in the absence of discounts.**

In my view, this isn’t entirely true, at least in India.
For example:

• Recent news highlighted how Jio and Airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes.

• How many of us stick to just one quick commerce app? Isn’t it common to compare prices between Swiggy and Zomato before ordering food?


**2. The elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price:**

Again, I’m unsure how long this will hold true. The same elite crowd often shops at stores like Zudio and Westside for the in-store experience, rather than relying on online platforms like Myntra or Amazon.

1. Personally, I used to buy meat from an online app for several years. However, after receiving stale meat once, I switched to buying meat directly from shops. These shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options.


One alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of over 315 for Zomato—a tech company with a profit of just ₹250+ crores—while being hesitant to invest in DMart, which has a profit exceeding ₹650+ crores and a much lower P/E of 87.

In my opinion, the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor. However, how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer. Until then, I believe both quick commerce and brick-and-mortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar.

In this post we are going to explore 3 stocks where Big Bulls has invested today.

1. **Kabra Extrusion Technik Ltd.**

Biz. Sustainability Rate is low at 6% which reflects in their recent Sales Growth: **-9%.** However its recent EPS growth is at 13%. Target drops to 433 INR.

2. **Senores Pharmaceuticals Ltd.** (Recent IPO). Due to recent IPO not enough reliable public data is available. Recent Biz. Sustainability Rate is good at 32%, although ROCE dipped a bit to 12%. Biz. numbers are not convincing. Target is subjective to market conditions. **Hence too soon to invest for retail investors.**

3. **Avonmore Capital & Management Ltd**. Target is calculated at 15. Meaning there is no safety margin for retail investors  (15-18)/18 = **-16% (minus).** Ideally this safety margin should be >> 30% for retail investors to invest.

Hope this helps.

Lets do for **Snowman Logistics** : You can easily calculate the PE growth momentum of last 3 years: -32%.

EPS Growth momentum: 96% in last 3 years. 

Now simply multiplyCurrent PE \* (1 + (-32%)) \* Current EPS \* (1 + (96%)).

It will give the intrinsic value based on last 3 years performance, do the same for 5 years.

Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.

Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.

Reddit,gem aromatics ipo,"Beginners Guide to Investing in Share Markets For investing in the Indian stock market, there are a few pre-requisites that I would like to mention first. Here are the few things that you will need to[ invest in the share market:](https://portal.tradebrains.in/?tb=Nipu943b)

1. Bank Savings account
2. Trading and Demat account
3. Computer/laptop/mobile
4. Internet connection

For opening a Demat and trading account (usually opened altogether and called a 2-in-1 account), the following documents are required:

1. PAN Card
2. Aadhar card (for address proof)
3. Canceled cheque/Bank Statement/Passbook
4. Passport size photos

You can have your savings account in any private/public Indian bank.

3 Basic Advice Before You Start Investing

When you are new to the stock market, you enter with lots of dreams and expectations. You might be planning to invest your savings and make lakhs in return.

Although there are hundreds of examples of people who had created huge wealth from the stock market, however, there are also thousands who didn’t.

Here are a few cautionary points for people who are just entering the world of investing.

**— Pay down your ‘High-Interest’ debts first**

If you have any kind of high-interest paying debts like personal loans, credit card dues debts, etc, then pay them first. The interests of these loans can be even as high as your returns from the market. There is no point in wasting your energy to give all the returns you made from the market as interests of your debts. Pay down these debts before entering the market.

**— Invest only your additional/ surplus fund**

Stop right there if you are planning to invest your next semester tuition fee, next month flat rent, savings for your daughter’s marriage which is going to happen next year, or any similar reasons.

Only invest the amount that won’t affect your daily life. In addition, investing in debts/loans is really a bad idea, especially when you are new and learning how to invest in the share market.

**— Keep some cash in hand**

The cash in hand doesn’t just serve as your emergency fund. It also serves as your key to freedom. You can take big steps like changing your little flat, or quit your annoying job, or simply shifting to a new city, only when you have cash in hand.

Do not get trapped by investing all your money and later losing your freedom. Do not sacrifice your personal freedom in the name of financial freedom.

# How to Invest in Share Market in India?

**Step 1: Define your investment goals**

It’s important to start with defining your investment goals. Start with end goals in mind. Know what you want.

Do you want to grow your saved money (capital appreciation) to beat inflation and get higher returns? Do you want to build a passive income from your investments through dividends? Are you investing in a specific goal? Or do you just want to have fun in the market along with creating wealth?

If you want to just have fun and want to learn, that’s okay. But make sure that you do not over-invest or get too much attracted to the market? Moreover, most people start the same way and define their goals later.

Anyways, if you are starting for [Goal-Based Investing,](https://www.tradebrains.in/goal-based-investing/) do remember that the time frame for different investment goals will be different. Your goal can be anything like buying a new house, new car, funding your higher education, children’s marriage, retirement, etc. However, if you are investing in your retirement, then you have a bigger time frame compared to if you are investing in buying your first house.

When you know your goals, you can decide how much you want and for how long you have to remain invested.

**Step 2: Create a plan/strategy**

Now that you know your goals, you need to define your strategies. You might need to figure out whether you want to invest in the [lump sum (a large amount at a time) or by the SIP (systematic investment plan)](https://www.tradebrains.in/sip-or-lump-sum/) approach. If you are planning small periodic investments, analyze how much you want to invest monthly.

There’s a common misconception among our society that you need large savings to get started. Say, one lakh or above. But that’s not true. As a thumb rule, first, build an [emergency fund](https://tradebrains.in/emergency-fund/), and next start allocating a fixed amount let’s say 10-20% of your monthly income to save and invest. You can use the remaining portion of your earnings for paying your bills, mortgages, etc. Nevertheless, even if your allocated amount turns out to be Rs 3-5k or more, it’s good enough to build an investing habit.

**Step 3: Read some investing books**

There are a number of decent books on stock market investing that you can read to brush up on the basics. Few good books that I will suggest the beginners should read are:

* [The Intelligent Investor ](http://amzn.to/2AcNXWJ)by Benjamin Graham
* [One up on wall street ](http://amzn.to/2An6d0k)by Peter Lynch
* [Common stocks and uncommon profits](http://amzn.to/2GfDIny) by Philip Fisher
* [The Dhandho Investor](https://www.tradebrains.in/the-dhandho-investor-book-review/) by Mohnish Pabrai
* [The little book that beats the Market](http://amzn.to/2GgesgG) by Joel Greenblatt

Besides, there are a couple of more books that you can read to build good basics of the stock market. You can find the list of ten must-read books for Indian stock investors [here](https://www.tradebrains.in/category/books/).

**Step 4: Choose your stock broker**

Deciding on an online broker is one of the biggest steps that you need to take. There are two types of stockbrokers in India:

1. Full-service brokers
2. Discount brokers

— Full-Service Brokers (Traditional Brokers)

They are traditional brokers who provide trading, research, and advisory facility for stocks, commodities, and currency. These brokers charge commissions on every trade their clients execute. They also facilitate investing in Forex, Mutual Funds, IPOs, FDs, Bonds, and Insurance.

Few examples of full-time brokers are ICICIDirect, Kotak Security, HDFC Sec, Sharekhan, Motilal Oswal, etc

— Discount Brokers (Budget Brokers)

Discount brokers just provide the trading facility for their clients. They do not offer advisory and hence suitable for a ‘do-it-yourself’ type of clients. They offer low brokerage, high speed, and a decent platform for trading in stocks, commodities, and currency derivatives.

A few examples of discount brokers are Zerodha, Upstocs, 5 Paisa, Trade Smart Online, Paytm Money, Groww, etc.

I will highly recommend you to choose discount brokers (like Zerodha) as it will save you a lot of brokerage charges.

Initially, I started trading with ICICI direct (which is a full-service broker), but soon realized that it was too expensive when compared to discount brokers. It doesn’t make sense to pay extra brokerage charges even if you get similar benefits. And that’s why I shifted to Zerodha as my broker.

Zerodha (a discount broker) charges a brokerage of 0.01% or Rs 20 (whichever is lower) per executed order on Intraday, irrespective of the number of shares or their prices. For delivery, there is a zero brokerage charge in Zerodha. Therefore, the maximum brokerage that you’ve to pay per trade while using the Zerodha platform is Rs 20 and it doesn’t depend on the volume of trading.

This is way cheaper compared to ICICI direct (full-service broker) which asks a brokerage of 0.55% on each transaction. If you buy stocks for Rs 50,000 in ICICI direct, then you have to pay a brokerage of Rs 275 for delivery trading i.e. when you hold the stock for more than one day in your Demat account.

Further, as this amount is charged on both sides of the delivery transaction (buying & selling), hence you have to pay a total of Rs 550 for the complete transactions in ICICI direct (way too expensive than Zerodha).

In short, if you are planning to open a new trading account, I would recommend opening accounts in a discount broker so that you can save lots of brokerages. [If you’re interested to open your account with Zerodha, here’s the direct link to fill account opening application!](https://tradebrains.in/get/zerodha/)

**Step 5: Start researching common stocks and invest**

Start noticing the companies around you. If you like the product or services of any company, dig deeper to find out more about its parent company, like whether it is listed on the stock exchange or not, what is its current share price, etc.

Most of the products or services that you use in day to day life — From soap, shampoo, cigarettes, bank, petrol pump, SIM card or even your inner wears, there is a company behind everyone. Start researching about them.

For example- if you’ve been using HDFC debit/credit card for a long time and satisfied with the experience, then investigate further about HDFC Bank. The information of all the listed companies in India is publicly available. Just a simple ‘Google search’ of ‘HDFC share price’ will give you a lot of important pieces of information. (Try it now!)

Similarly, if your neighbor bought a new Baleno car lately, they try to find out more about the parent company, i.e. Maruti Suzuki. What other products it offers and how is the company performing recently- like how are its sales, profits, etc.

You do not need to start investing in stocks with hidden gems. Start with the popular large-cap companies. And once you are comfortable in the market, invest in mid and small caps.

**Step 6: Select a platform to track your performance**

You can simply use an excel or google spreadsheet to track your stocks. Make a spreadsheet with three tables containing:

1. The stocks that you are interested in and need to study/investigate,
2. Those stocks that you have already studied and found decent,
3. Miscellaneous stock- for the other stocks that you want to track.

Else, you can do this by creating multiple watchlists on our Trade Brains Portal. Our Research and Analysis Portal offers users to make up to 5 watchlists and create portfolios. You can sign up on [**Trade Brains Portal**](https://portal.tradebrains.in/?tb=Nipu943b) for free to track your stock performance.

This way, you can easily follow the stocks. In addition, there are also a number of financial websites and mobile apps that you can use to keep track of the stocks. However, I would suggest you track your stocks on Trade Brains Portal.

**Step 7: Have an exit plan**

It’s always good to have an exit plan. There are two ways to exit a stock. Either by booking profit or by cutting a loss. Let’s discuss both these scenarios. Basically, there are only four scenarios when you should sell a good stock in your portfolio:

1. When you badly need money
2. When the stock fundamentals have changed
3. When you find a better investment opportunity and
4. When you have reached your investment goals.

If your investment goals are met, then you can exit the stocks happily. Or at least, book a portion of the profit from your stock portfolio and shift it to other safer investment options. On the other hand, if the stock has fallen under your risk appetite level, then again exit the stock. In short, always know your exit options before entering.",1621409140.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/nfz4mg/beginners_guide_to_investing_in_share_markets/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"*How India 🇮🇳 is going to witness the Mother of all Bull Markets by 2035*? 
According to McKinsey, these 10 sectors are about to explode. 

Some by 6 to 10x in the next decade.

This is not just growth. 
This is history being written. 

Over the next few years.

India will add up to $5 trillion to its economy.

That’s like building another India inside the current one.

But this time it’s not just IT and outsourcing.

This time we’re building chips, rockets, energy and AI.

These 10 sectors are about to define India’s next decade.

👉 Sector 1 : EVs and Batteries (6 times growth)

India is already the third largest car market.

But electric vehicles are the next ₹40 lakh crore wave.

Tata, Ola and Mahindra are building the vehicles.

But the real money is in lithium, charging infra and battery recycling.

One startup here could power 10 cities.

👉 Sector 2 : AI Software and Services (5 times growth)

Every Indian IT firm is quietly turning into an AI firm.

Infosys, TCS and Zoho are just the tip.

The new wave? Indian AI tools for law, medicine, education and Bharat languages.

McKinsey says this space alone can add ₹16 lakh crore to India’s GDP.

👉 Sector 3 : E-commerce (4 times growth)

In 2014, India had 5 crore online shoppers.

In 2030, we’ll cross 60 crore.

And they won’t just be on Flipkart or Amazon.

They’ll shop through voice, WhatsApp, influencers and rural fintech.

The market is moving from English to Hinglish. From metros to mandis.

👉 Sector 4 : Semiconductors (3 times growth)

India is done being just the software guy.

Now we want to make the chip inside the device.

Tata, Vedanta and Micron are setting up fabs with up to 50 percent government support.

If this clicks, India won’t just be assembling iPhones. We’ll be designing their brains.

👉 Sector 5 : Space (4 times growth)

This is no longer just ISRO.

In 2023 alone, over 100 space startups emerged in India.

From launching satellites to building reusable rockets, India is now SpaceX at one-tenth the cost.

The global demand for low-cost launches is sky-high. And India is ready to supply.

👉 Sector 6 : Nuclear Fission (5 times growth)

Sounds futuristic. But the future is now.

India needs 24 times more clean energy by 2047.

Nuclear is compact, zero-carbon and reliable.

And new-age reactors like SMRs are being quietly explored by giants like Reliance.

👉 Sector 7 : Renewable Energy and Storage (3 times growth)

India aims for 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030.

But solar panels and windmills are useless without storage.

This is where battery parks, hydrogen and pumped hydro come in.

Storage is the backbone of the green revolution.

👉 Sector 8 : Bio-to-X Technologies (3 times growth)

India generates over 75 crore tonnes of biomass every year.

That’s not waste. That’s fuel, packaging, electricity and even jet fuel.

Startups are converting crop residue into high-value exports.

Biotech is not just pharma anymore. It’s bio-everything.

👉 Sector 9 : Biopharma (4 times growth)

India already supplies 60 percent of the world’s vaccines.

But now we want to invent them too. 

From AI-based drug discovery to high-end biologics, Indian pharma is going from generic to genius.

This sector alone could become bigger than the entire IT industry in a decade.

👉 Sector 10 : Cybersecurity (2.5 times growth)

In 2023, India faced over 9 lakh cyber attacks.

As UPI, healthtech and govtech scale, data threats will multiply.

India is already building its own digital fortress.

Startups are creating India-specific tools for detection, prevention and recovery.

These 10 sectors could generate over 10 crore jobs.

They will define our IPOs, our exports, our college degrees and even our politics.

The next 25 years won’t be services led. They’ll be innovation led. 

India is not just growing. 

It is transforming into the world’s biggest bull market.",1756034317.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1mysyk4/how_india_is_going_to_witness_the_mother_of_all/

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"[IPO Analysis] EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd. Hey folks,

I started [helloquant ](https://helloquant.in/)as a side project. Will talk about it later in details. One thing I realized is for IPO, there is no good website which is clean and give analysis in a straight forward manner. So, we are starting an IPO Analysis Series where we look at upcoming Indian IPOs through a **quantitative lens** — no fluff, just data, valuations, risks, and context.

Our first breakdown is on **EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd.** (incorp 1999), a company in the business of pre-engineered steel buildings and prefabricated structures. They also manufacture EPS (thermocol) blocks, sheets, and packaging products.

# 📌 IPO Details

* **Price Band**: ₹194–204
* **Issue Size**: ₹504 Cr (Fresh ₹300 Cr + OFS ₹204 Cr)
* **Current GMP**: \~₹20
* **Use of Proceeds**: Capex, working capital, debt repayment

# 📊 Financial Highlights

* Revenue CAGR: **31.4%** (highest among peers)
* PAT growth: **57%**
* ROE: **22.69%** | ROCE: **22.88%**
* EBITDA Margin: **10%+**

# 🔎 Valuation vs Peers

Peers: PENIND, INTERARCH, EVERESTIND, BEARDSELL

* **P/E** = 34.54 (rich vs peers)
* **ROE** = 22.7% (highest among peers)
* **WC Days** = 35 (very efficient)

# 🧮 Strengths

* Strong presence in a growing prefab construction market

* Expanding capacity with IPO proceeds
* Fastest revenue growth among peers

# ⚓ Anchors & Analyst Views

* Anchor investors include **WhiteOak, 360One, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley**

# ⚠️ Risks

* Volatility in raw material prices (steel dependency)
* Execution risks in expansion
* Competition from larger, established players

# 💡 Our Take

At the upper band, valuations look **expensive on P/E basis**, but strong ROE, efficient working capital, and anchor participation show confidence. Might be interesting for listing gains, but medium/long-term depends on execution.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Automation Boosts Consistency in Indian Stock Market Trading Hey guys, I have curated some news articles for my trading setup today. Here are some interesting developments:

1. Premier Energies and JSW Holdings are among six stocks currently showing a bullish RSI upswing. I'm looking at these for potential entries if the bullish momentum sustains.

2. Nazara Technologies is approaching its record date for a 1:1 bonus issue and a 1:2 stock split. This could increase liquidity and attract more retail investors; I'm considering a closer analysis to see if it aligns with my algo setups.

3. Quest Global might sell up to 6% of its holdings to raise over $200 million. Such moves often influence market sentiment, and I might short if there's a significant dip post-announcement.

4. Jinkushal Industries has secured Rs 35 crore from anchor investors ahead of its IPO. IPOs can be volatile, but they also offer opportunities; I'll be watching this one to see how it performs.

5. TruAlt Bioenergy has raised Rs 252 crore via anchor book ahead of its IPO. Similar to Jinkushal, this could be an opportunity for a quick trade depending on the initial market response.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Tomorrow Market Prediction: Market Recap, Levels & Strategies for September 24, 2025 Hello and welcome back to Replete Equities! If trading or investing in the Indian stock market is your game, then this update is for you. We’re breaking down today’s market action and what it means for tomorrow, September 24, 2025. From Nifty and Bank Nifty key levels to option market insights and fresh news, here’s everything you need to approach tomorrow’s trading with confidence.

1. Market Recap: September 23, 2025 – A Day of Consolidation and Caution

Nifty 50 slipped slightly, closing down 32.85 points (−0.13%) at 25,169.50. The trading range for the day was between 25,246.25 and 25,085—reflecting a cautious market that failed to hold onto early gains. Midcap and smallcap indices followed suit, edging lower by about half a percent.

Bank Nifty saw similar cautious sentiment, closing modestly lower at 55,248.70, with intraday swings between 55,624 and 55,143.

In terms of sector performance, banking and metals showed resilience and helped contain downside pressure, while FMCG stocks faced some selling. Big movers on the upside were IndusInd Bank, JSW Steel, Axis Bank, and Bajaj Finance. On the downside, weaker stocks included Trent, Tech Mahindra, SBI Life, UltraTech Cement, and HUL.

The overall market breadth remained negative, confirming a day of profit-booking and sideways movement.

2. Key Support & Resistance Levels to Watch Tomorrow:

Knowing where the market might find footing or hit a wall helps you position better. Here’s the precise outlook for both key indices:

Nifty 50:

I. Support: 25,100 (immediate), followed by 25,060–25,030 zone. The broader 24,900 to 25,000 zone remains a critical medium-term safety net.
II. Resistance: 25,200–25,250 in the short term, then 25,400, which has strong call option writing confirming resistance in this band.

Nifty is under pressure but holding above crucial support, indicating potential for consolidation or mild recovery if 25,100 holds firm.

Bank Nifty:

I. Support: 55,100 first line of defense; if broken, watch next at 55,000.
II. Resistance: 55,500–55,600, then 56,000 on a strong breakout.

Bank Nifty’s near-term moves will be highly dependent on these key pivot points. A move above resistance levels could signal fresh bullish momentum, while a break down may intensify caution.

3. Option Chain Insights: What the Market’s Big Players are Signaling;

The option chain data reveals market expectations and potential volatility zones:

Nifty: The heaviest call open interest clusters around the 25,400–25,500 strikes, marking strong resistance caps. Conversely, put open interest peaks at 25,100 and 25,000 provide vital support levels. Interesting to note is substantial option writing at the 25,200 strike on both calls and puts, suggesting the market anticipates rangebound movement near that level unless influenced by substantial news. The put-call ratio (PCR) is balanced, showing no dominant bias at this point.

Bank Nifty: Peaks in open interest appear at 55,000 (put side – support) and 56, 000 (call side – resistance). This indicates anticipated consolidation and potential for sharp moves only if these critical levels are decisively broken. With the weekly expiry approaching soon, expect these pivots to be key decision zones for traders.


4. Key News and Market Triggers for Tomorrow:

I. Global cues remain mixed. Asian markets showed some pressure while US markets remained steady, adding layers of uncertainty for Indian markets. Crude oil and currency movements continue to keep traders on toes.

II. IPO happenings: The Ganesh Consumer Products IPO continues but with muted subscriber interest. Its performance over the coming days remains a point of attention for market participants.

III. No impactful bulk deals or major policy announcements were seen today, keeping the market mostly driven by sector-specific and global cues.
What’s the Sentiment? Trading Advice for Tomorrow

5. The tone is cautious and slightly negative. Here’s what to keep in mind:

I. For Nifty, maintain a neutral to mildly bearish stance between 25,050 and 25,250.
Buyers should consider entering near the lower support zones (around 25,100), but keep tight stops if prices drop below 25,000.

II. For Bank Nifty, bulls should look for a clear breakout above 55,500 before committing more capital. Falling below 55,000 should raise alarm bells and encourage risk reduction.

III. Sector wise, tread carefully, especially avoiding IT stocks, which face headwinds related to US H-1B visa fee hikes. Consumption and industrials may offer better relative strength in this phase.

IV. Volatility indexes are elevated — adopting spread strategies picking rangebound moves is a safer bet than outright directional bets.

Overall, expect choppy, range-bound trading until fresh catalysts emerge. Play the range and be ready for quick exits.

6. Final Thoughts: Stay Prepared, Stay Nimble

Markets are showing more resistance to upside moves but aren’t ready for a full turnaround either. The best approach for tomorrow is to remain nimble, keep stops close, and watch those technical levels closely. Volatility remains your friend if you trade smartly, and risk management will be your best ally as expiry nears.

3. Atlanta Electricals is launching its IPO today, with Grey Market Premium (GMP) indicating a strong listing. IPOs with high GMPs usually attract a lot of attention, so I might look for opportunities to trade on the listing day.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Small caps go brrr Small caps go brrr hopefully 🤞 


I am heavily invested in small caps and I believe in these companies future. 

1. Drone destination- heavily betting on this one the financials look great since it launched in 2023 it’s been a robust company. Plus this company has the advantage of having qualified and great directors plus the government is continuing to sign mou’s and when the sector opens up it in my naive assessment maybe will blow up. 

2. Filatex- even though net cash flow might have declined marginally so I’d say but the promoters and FII as well as DII have booked profits but still are significantly invested in this company.

3. MIL- this company last I checked had good financials this time I did not so much but I am still positive on it as it deals in pharmaceutical ingredients and I have a overall positive view of the industry. The debt to equity ratio looks great. Profit is somewhat stagnant. So we’ll see about this company in a while. 

4. IRB & JWL- In IRB the promoters continuously have decreased their holdings but their profit was the highest this year and so was the revenue the debt to equity ratio also is 1.36 which is good enough if I hit 20% loss then I might think of getting out. 
JWL, I am betting on it big as I feel there is a lot of growth to be seen in the railways and this company will play a pivotal role in it plus this year the net profit and revenue has increased like crazy and the last quarter was really great as well. 

5. MEFCOMCAP- Oh do I have a crazy positive outlook towards this it has launched 240 successful IPO’s plus it has it’s hands in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions. Revenue increased to 232cr from 62cr in 2023 till now plus they registered a loss of -5 cr but made a turnaround this year with a reported profit of 8cr till now, and promoters are holding on to almost 75% of the shares. 
I feel like going ahead it’s going to grow more as we’ll have more of these corporate opportunities like IPO, mergers, acquisitions etc etc. 

6. VERTOZ- Operators are toying with this one right now and it’s available at a huge discount it provides IT services plus it has it’s own softwares with clients like google, amazon etc etc. The company provides cloud services as well and has data centers in Mumbai, New York, London and San Francisco. Net profit has increased from 11 to 16 cr this year already and revenue has increased from 82 to 155cr. I do feel like why has the profit not increased that much and will probably look into it but seems to me that it’s a very well run and robust company. 

I obviously have taken a lot of risk in my portfolio I might regret it but let’s just say I am yolo ing on these stocks. Is there any advice or some guidance anyone could give I’d really appreciate it.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Why I Believe Ather Energy Will Be a Multibagger Hey Folks, I’ve been diving deep into Ather Energy since their IPO hit the scene in April 2025, and I’m convinced this EV two-wheeler (E2W) company has the potential to be a multibagger over the next 5-10 years. Here’s my take on why Ather could deliver massive returns for long-term investors. Buckle up, this is gonna be a detailed ride!


1. Riding the Electric Vehicle Megatrend in India  
India’s EV market is on fire, and Ather is perfectly positioned to capitalize. The Indian E2W market is projected to grow to 10–12 million units annually by FY31, driven by rising fuel costs, government incentives, and increasing environmental awareness. Ather, as the fourth-largest E2W manufacturer in India (behind Ola Electric, TVS, and Bajaj), already commands a 10.6% market share in FY24, with ambitions to hit 20% in the near term. 

Unlike traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) scooters, EVs offer lower running costs—think ₹600 in electricity vs. ₹5,200 in fuel for a petrol scooter over 80 km daily. Ather’s focus on premium, tech-laden scooters like the 450X and family-oriented Rizta appeals to both urban millennials and mass-market buyers, giving them a broad addressable market.

Why it matters: With government policies pushing for 30% EV penetration by 2030 and subsidies like FAME-III, Ather’s growth is backed by strong tailwinds. Their ability to scale volumes (42% YoY increase in FY25) shows they’re already gaining traction.


2. Innovation and Premium Positioning  
Ather isn’t just another EV maker—they’re the Apple of Indian E2Ws. Their scooters are packed with cutting-edge tech:  
- Smart features: Google Maps integration, multi-stop Trip Planner, Bluetooth connectivity, and Theft & Tow Alerts. 
- In-house R&D: With over 700 R&D employees and hundreds of patents, Ather designs critical components like motor controllers, dashboards, and battery packs in-house, ensuring quality and cost control.
- Ather Grid: They’ve built India’s largest EV two-wheeler fast-charging network, with 3,100+ charging points across 80+ cities, giving them a moat against competitors.

Their premium positioning sets them apart from budget players like Ola Electric, which often face quality complaints. Posts on X and Reddit rave about Ather’s build quality, ride experience, and service, with users calling it “the king in the south.” Ather’s ability to tap both the premium (450X, Apex) and mass-market (Rizta) segments gives them pricing power and scalability.

Why it matters: Ather’s tech-first approach and brand loyalty mirror companies like Tesla in their early days. As EVs become mainstream, their premium scooters will likely command higher margins, boosting profitability.

3. Financials Improving, Path to Profitability  
Yes, Ather is loss-making (₹1,059.7 Cr net loss in FY24), but the numbers tell a promising story.  
- Revenue growth: FY24 revenue was ₹1,789.1 Cr, and FY25 saw a 29% rise in total income.  
- Margin improvement: Adjusted Gross Margin doubled to 19% in FY25, and EBITDA margin improved from -34% to -23%. 
- Cost optimization: Ather’s new Rizta model has 7% lower Bill of Materials (BOM) costs, and their upcoming Factory 3.0 in Maharashtra will boost capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws annually, driving economies of scale. 

Their IPO proceeds (₹2,626 Cr fresh issue) will fund R&D, manufacturing expansion, and marketing, reducing reliance on external debt. Plus, their asset-light distribution model (third-party experience and service centers) keeps overheads low.

Why it matters: Multibaggers often start as loss-making companies with high growth potential. Ather’s improving margins and strategic investments mirror early-stage tech giants that turned profitable as they scaled.


4. Strong Backing and Market Confidence  
Ather’s investor lineup reads like a who’s who of Indian business:  
- Hero MotoCorp owns a 38%+ stake, providing industry expertise and financial muscle.
- Sachin Bansal (Flipkart founder) has poured in millions, signaling long-term confidence.
- NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund) invested $71M in 2024, pushing Ather to unicorn status ($1B valuation).  

Their IPO was a hit, with retail investors and institutions showing strong interest, despite some skepticism about the $2.5B valuation. Posts on X highlight Ather’s “impressive” scale and market share, reflecting positive sentiment.

Why it matters: Backing from heavyweights like Hero and NIIF reduces financial risk and signals Ather’s credibility. Hero’s distribution network could also supercharge Ather’s reach in Tier 2/3 cities.

5. Competitive Edge in a Crowded Market
The E2W space is heating up, with Ola Electric, TVS, Bajaj, and even Honda in the mix. But Ather has distinct advantages:  
- Quality over quantity: Unlike Ola, which faces criticism for poor quality and service, Ather’s scooters are praised for reliability and performance.  
- Niche focus: Ather targets urban, tech-savvy buyers and families, avoiding direct price wars with budget brands.  
- Charging infrastructure: Ather Grid’s 3,100+ fast chargers give them an edge over competitors with limited networks.

While reliance on imported components (e.g., from China) and government subsidies pose risks, Ather’s in-house manufacturing and vertical integration mitigate these.

Why it matters: In a competitive market, Ather’s focus on quality, tech, and infrastructure creates a defensible moat, positioning them to outpace rivals as the market consolidates.

Risks to Consider
No investment is a slam dunk, and Ather has challenges:  
- Profitability timeline: Losses may persist for a few years as they invest in growth.
- Competition: Ola’s aggressive pricing and Bajaj’s Chetak are formidable threats.  
- Valuation concerns: Some Reddit users called the IPO’s $2.5B valuation “frothy” compared to the $1.3B valuation in a pre-IPO round.
- External risks: Supply chain disruptions or changes in government subsidies could hurt margins. 

That said, multibaggers are rarely “safe” bets. The key is Ather’s ability to execute, and their track record—scaling to 109,577 units in FY24 and 107,983 in 9M FY25—shows they can deliver.


Why Ather Could Be a Multibagger
Multibaggers often share these traits: a growing market, innovative products, improving financials, and strong management. Ather checks all these boxes:  
- Market growth: India’s E2W market is set to explode, and Ather’s 10.6% share is just the start.  
- Innovation: Their tech and charging network set them apart.  
- Financial trajectory: Doubling gross margins and reducing losses show a clear path to profitability.  
- Leadership: Founders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain have built Ather from a startup to a unicorn, backed by industry giants.  

If Ather captures 20% market share by FY30 (as CEO Tarun Mehta targets) and turns profitable, their revenue could multiply, driving the stock price to 5x–10x returns. Compare this to early Tesla or even Indian multibaggers like Eicher Motors, which rode the premium two-wheeler wave.

My Strategy
I’m bullish on Ather for the long haul (5–10 years). I’ve allocated a small portion of my portfolio to their stock, treating it as a high-risk, high-reward bet. I’ll monitor their quarterly results, especially volume growth, margin expansion, and Factory 3.0’s progress. If the stock dips due to market volatility, I’ll consider averaging down, as EV stocks can be volatile in their early years.


TL;DR
Ather Energy is a premium EV two-wheeler maker with a 10.6% market share, strong innovation, and a growing charging network. Despite current losses, their 42% volume growth, doubling gross margins, and backing from Hero MotoCorp and NIIF make them a compelling long-term bet. With India’s E2W market set to boom, Ather has the potential to be a 5x–10x multibagger for patient investors.  

What do you folks think? Bullish on Ather, or are the risks too high? Let’s discuss! 👇

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"International Gemmological Institute Limited - Diamonds or Dust? International Gemmological Institute (IGI) is the largest diamond and jewelry certifying body in India with ~50% MS in India and ~33% global market share.

IGI is the second largest diamond certifying body after GIA, who created the modern grading of Diamonds (i.e. - 4C’s - Colour, Cut, Carat and Clarity). GIA on the other hand has over ~50% global market share with a substantial market share in USA.

IGI has the first mover advantage in grading Lab-grown Diamonds (LGD’s) where they have 65% market share.

IGI -

IGI has 3 entities - India, Belgium and Netherlands. Belgium and Netherlands entities were acquired post IPO for a consideration of ~155 million USD (~1300 crores).

India is the largest entity contributing over 80% of revenues and 95% of EBITDA in CY24, whereas Belgium and Netherlands have a smaller contribution.

98% of revenues comes from certifications and accreditions whereas 2 percent comes from training and education.

Certifications costs at 3-5 percent at wholesale level. Broadly certification cost are at 1000 rupee per report.

IGI’s unique proposition and asset light model results in over 73% EBITDA Margins and ~100% ROCE, amongst the top 1% company in India and globally in terms of margins and capital allocation.

IGI India -

IGI India caters to Top 9/10 jewelry chains in India ( except Tanishq which does in-house)

IGI certifies Natural Diamond, Lab Grown Diamonds, Jewelry and colored stones.



Margins for the company across segments are LGD > Natural Diamonds > Jewelry and Colored Stones

Margin profile in Domestic is at 72-73% EBITDA margins.

IGI overseas operations -

IGI has 2 subsidiaries - Belgium and Netherlands.

Belgium entities overseas Belgium and USA whereas Netherlands entity overseas Netherlands, China, Hong-Kong, Middle-East and other countries.

Currently, the overseas entities operate at a sub-optimal level resulting in operating margins at ~10% v/s India margins at 72-73% EBITDA margins.



Growth Indicators -

Growth in Lab-grown Diamonds -

From CY21-24, IGI grew on back of strong LGD growth at 30% CAGR in volumes and 29% / 34% / 37% in Revenue / EBITDA / PAT.

In-terms of diamond production 18% of total diamonds produced are now Lab-grown v/s 9% in 2019.

Lab-grown Diamonds boom has been led by limited product differentiation, product affordability and newer generations adoption.

The entire longer term thesis for IGI can be on the back of what thesis you subscribe to -

LGD continuing to replace Diamond market

Price Erosion in LGD making it a differentiated market v/s LGD.

Natural Diamonds losing their shine ?

Diamonds were meant to be forever, but with the exodus of LGD and affordable jewelry, will LGD replace and destroy diamonds forever or will the mighty old diamond make a comeback?

Natural Diamond Industry declined by 2.4 billion USD (~8% in CY23) with 50% decline led by wider adoption of LGD’s.



Natural Diamonds have also lost their ability as store of value with prices down ~40% from peak.



According to De Beers, among the world’s largest natural diamond company, the below chart shows supply coming down materially as natural diamond miners continue to try and artificially inflate prices below.



Lab-grown Diamonds have replaced a part of Natural Diamonds due to better affordability but lab grown diamonds pricing has seen a steep decline with a price correction of over 60% in CY24.



The steep decline in LGD poses challenges to IGI’s certification pricing and further declines in LGD prices cannot be ruled out owing to better manufacturing capabilities driving down prices further.

IGI had to drop prices in April-May of it’s certifications because of drop in LGD prices resulting in volume-pricing impact which is expected to continue for next 2 quarters.

While pricing has remained relatively stable over the last 9-10 months, any further sharp pricing decline can de-rail IGI’s growth trajectory.



The need for certification -

IGI is in a sweet spot where certification need is only rising for both natural and LGD with certification companies being disproportionate winners in the fight between Natural Diamonds and Lab-grown Diamonds.

With rise in LGD’s, the need for certification for natural diamonds is on the rise, with differentiation being one of the key selling points for natural diamonds

Lab-grown diamonds are on a nascent stage, where LGD certification is following Natural Diamond certification to separate it from lower end jewelry such as one with American Diamonds.

Key risks
-The key risk for IGI is a steep drop in LGD prices which makes certification costs unviable. 

Overseas subsidiaries have performed poorly in CY24 and if these entities don’t turn-around they will be a drag on both profitability and margins in the years to come.Margin headwinds especially in India is likely as the company is adding employees in order to cater to volumes increasing.Conclusion - IGI’s competitive advantages, unparalleled financial economics and strong presence in a fast growing segment makes it an interesting business to evaluate.

However with the ever-evolving LGD segment and sharp pricing fluctuations, it can easily turn tailwind into a headwind especially historically highest margins.

Whether IGI will benefit from LGD boom is a question mark at the moment. Only time will tell.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Jeyyam Global Foods SME IPO found some more interesting points too.

There are three more companies linked with the promoter. All are listed in the SME market, and all are in poor financial conditions.
The company names are

1) Shantiguru Industries (formerly named as RCL Retail).
2) Jetmall Spices and Masala Limited
3) AASTAMANGALAM FINANCE LIMITED (formerly named Upasana Finance Limited).

All have head office in Chennai. The first two companies, Shantiguru and Jetmall, are in the same business as Jeyyam Global Foods. Then what is the need for another one? While searching in Google Maps, I couldn't find the Jeyyam Global Foods office building. It's showing somewhere.

Reading more..

Adding below Points..

I checked their previous company's listing gain and data.

1) Shantiguru Industries (formerly named RCL Retail). It listed at Rs 10 in October 2012 and went up to Rs 48 in December 2013 within one year. However, it later went down to Rs 4 in April 2022 and is currently trading at Rs 35.

2) Similarly, Jetmall Spices and Masala Limited listed at Rs 20 in April 2021 and reached its all-time high of Rs 30 in April 2022. Currently, it is trading at Rs 10.

In both companies, the total number of shareholders is around 300 only (Jetmall total shareholders are 200 and Shantiguru total shareholders are 358). In the Promotor Group, I can see a lot of HUF family names, so in that 300 shareholders, half of them will be HUF relatives. So they can easily manipulate the shares to go up and down.

Based on my assumption, we can expect a 20-30% gain on listing. However, the share price is likely to increase for some time before eventually going below the IPO price.

Premier Energies - Bought in Sep. Was exploring from IPO. Business looked strong, sector is growing. Didn’t get IPO but bought it 2-3 days later

CDSL - Bought in Aug. Largely due to FOMO. Was getting mentioned everywhere. Also thought that with lot of people like me exploring stock marker they probably will have good potential


Dhanuka, Kaveri - Bought in July. Post budget started exploring Agri industry. Fundamentals looked strong.

Here is my analysis and reason for holding: 
1) Company in great sector solar panels and solar pumps.
2) Company is a competitor with shakti pump, having similar clients. Shakti pumps has give a phenomenal result with 5x sales YoY.. so I am thinking a similar trajectory as both these peer have similar clients.
3) listed at a PE of 30.. which is half of the industry average at 60. 
4) This year we had many SME solar based ipos and most of them are over 300-500% from their IPO price. 
5) The company itself is growing its profits and sales with great ROE 53% and RoCE 39%
6) Govt clients have 72% pf revenue split.
7) Gove push to clean energy and push in solar sector.
8) Company has 100MW production capacity but only using 25% utilization. The scope for scale is huge here. 

Though its not that easy as company has some risks as well :
1) Debt js high for its size. D/E ratio of 1.7 
2) 70% business from Solar pumps where shakti pump is a huge competitor.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Is Swiggy Listed In Stock Market? Funding, IPO, and Acquisitions! In this article, we will address a common question about the popular food delivery app, Swiggy — whether it is listed on the stock market. Despite being a beloved platform for ordering food, many people are curious about investing in the company. As the online food delivery market in India continues to grow, with projections reaching $20.26 billion by 2027, established players like Swiggy and Zomato have solidified their positions in the industry.

### About The Company

Swiggy is a food delivery company that operates in India, connecting customers to local restaurants for home, workplace, or college delivery. The company was established in 2014 in Bengaluru. The app lists all types of restaurants and customers can place orders through the application. Before addressing the question of whether or not Swiggy is listed on the stock market, let’s examine the company’s business model.

### How Is Swiggy Expanding Its Business?

Swiggy has a history of acquiring other companies, with Dineout being the most recent at a cost of $200 million. These acquisitions include Dineout, Kint, Supr Daily, Scootsy, and 48East. The startup has been funded by 40 investors, including 14 lead investors. Some of the venture capital firms that have invested in the billion-dollar company, as reported by EquityZen, include Wellington Management, Tencent Holdings, Samsung Ventures, Accel, Norwest Venture Partners, and SAIF Partners.

### How Much Has Swiggy Raised?

Swiggy has raised a significant amount of funding, totaling 3.6 billion dollars, which has allowed the company to conduct five acquisitions, the most recent being Dineout for $200 million in 2022. The company’s current valuation is $10.7 billion dollars, with a recent Softbank round raising an additional 700 million dollars, doubling its valuation from $5.5 billion last year.

### Is Swiggy Listed In Stock Market?

The answer is no, Swiggy is not currently listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange or the National Stock Exchange. A company is considered publicly listed in India if its common stock is available on these exchanges. However, some pre-IPO companies trade in unlisted markets, and the share prices can be found on websites such as Altius Investech and Unlistedzone.com.

Swiggy’s main competitor, Zomato, is listed on the NSE and BSE, having gone public in July 2021 with a price of ₹72-₹76 and opening at a premium of ₹126 per share. Since listing, the company’s share price has been falling consistently. Together, Swiggy and Zomato hold a 90% market share in the food delivery market in India.

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"Don't be poor in 2022! 2021, though not as gruesome as 2020, was a year with mixed feelings for all. For most of us, it brought new beginnings and changes. A lot of things happened in the economy and wealth space as well. In an effort to recover from the pandemic, the budget made a lot of new changes. Capital flowed to the country, number of retail investors surged like anything, unemployment fell and IPOs were the flavour of the season.

However, there was some bad stuff too. The volatility index shot up like nothing before, inflation was at record high levels and many people were facing a cash crunch. Here are a few common mistakes people made in such times followed by some remedies and mindset shift guides that can help you take better hold of your finances.

### 1. Savings deplete if you don’t replenish

2021 wasn’t as smooth as people expected it to be. Many of us had to use up our savings, just to survive. Businesses who were just hanging by were cut off in the second wave. Many were laid off their jobs, although employment seemed to recover in the latter part of 2021. Here is how people think about their savings according to a Times of India report:

https://preview.redd.it/97dje7p90n981.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be00a089f46f09fb1e050373912c6a3219e72bef

Have an emergency fund

Though it may sound basic, more than 60% of the people lack what is known as an emergency fund. Quite intuitively, it is like a reserve fund meant to be used at uncertain times like these. Not only does it keep you at peace mentally, but acts as a buffer that supports you in times of unpredictable losses, urgent monetary requirements and pandemics.

Financial planners suggest having at least 6 months of living expenses in a liquid instrument like a bank savings account or fixed deposit. Giving priority to such a fund over other investments is highly recommended.

#### Create more sources of income

Protection from the uncertainty of income can be achieved by either savings/investments or another source of income. Most millionaires claim to have at least 5 different sources of income.

You too, can consider building another source of income. Freelancing is something many people have resorted to especially in the pandemic. Established companies and startups are increasingly looking for contract workers to cut costs and stay afloat in uncertain times. The freelancing industry is set to take off in the following years, if it hasn’t started already.

Here is a BCG report which shows how people are freelancing to add to their current income:

https://preview.redd.it/x4wti0la0n981.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e52e3174a1bc62a485e06430f839956cee48d34d

 

### 2. Hopping on to the bandwagon

As most of you must know, this year witnessed record number of new investors in the Indian equity market. The low price was an excellent opportunity for investors to buy at cheap prices for short term gains. People took interest in investing and the economic stimulus by the government signaling the start of a new business cycle were major reasons. 

 Investing in the bull run helps make a lot of gains, but it tricks people into thinking that they know how to invest. Situations let people achieve above-average profits, but not everyone can sustain it. Extreme volatility caused by new age IPOs, foreign investor outflows and the pandemic news isn’t something that newbies are immune to. Such turmoil can lead to unchecked losses.

#### Invest your way

You have taken the right step by choosing to invest. But just trying to copy finance influencers or acting on random stock recommendations would cause more harm than good.

https://preview.redd.it/mr9emiab0n981.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48dd82be205fafbc63f0ad94a9075fec080bbf4

Everyone has different goals and risk appetites. One strategy of investing won’t suit everyone. It’s important to invest in a way that is consistent with your goals and circumstances. The best way to choose the right instruments is to make a note of your goals, define your time horizon, and establish your risk appetite. Picking assets that improve your overall portfolio in the long term is the right approach. An SIP or ETF would be a good way to get started in the stock markets.

 Don’t time the market

You can never say what the future holds. Analysts are often able to predict the direction of markets but no one has been able to do it successfully at all times. Bottom line, you shouldn’t predict the markets either. Trying to achieve an accurate prediction isn’t worth it. It’s better to keep investing regularly and stay invested for the long term rather than speculating, unless you want to trade as a career.

### 3. Inflation is real

When the economic activity of a country is at a low, money supply is increased to stimulate economic activity in an effort to get it back to normal levels. As only the quantity of money increases, the value of it goes down and the same good becomes costlier than before. This phenomenon, called inflation is one of the most tracked metrics around the globe. Here is a stat depicting rising wholesale & consumer rates of inflation:

https://preview.redd.it/nk1nq7pb0n981.jpg?width=521&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f8418dc5220a03086023b26fe4fc35321a68eab

 High inflation levels of over 6% in the USA and as high as 6.3% in India as of May 2021 indicate that investing needs to be more lucrative.

#### Measure ‘real’ returns

Emphasis should be placed on correctly measuring our real returns. There is no value in earning 8% a year if inflation is depleting our wealth by 9% every year.

Keeping track of your income, expenses and return on investments can go a long way. Stay abreast with news on the GDP and inflation numbers. This may also help you understand the economy and personal finance lessons better. Make sure that you aim at achieving rates of returns that are covering inflation at least. A prudent approach would be to discard instruments that do not assist your portfolio in beating inflation levels.

### 4. Patience

Making money and investing is not a hobby or interest, it’s a lifestyle, a mindset. Real wealth is built over decades, not days. Warren Buffet, one of the richest in the world, has made most of his wealth post the age of 60.

Don’t aim to make quick profits and don’t fall for get rich quick schemes either. One of the best practices you can adopt for your long term financial health is to invest regularly without fail. Consistently investing in the right assets in accordance with your goal, and being patient throughout will give you the best returns, since habits and money, both compound greatly over long periods of time.

*To conclude, we may say that whether we made money or lost some this year, it has left us with some lifelong lessons. Best wishes for your financial life in 2022!*

Reddit,mangal industries ipo,"DMart Business Model and Success Mantra – How Does DMart Make Money? **DMart Business Model Explained:** “One must not open any store within a 1km radius of DMart”. This is a common saying in the retail industry to avoid direct competition with DMart. So what makes DMart so special to customers or so threatening to its competition. What are the strategies that have catapulted the retail chain to where stands today? Keep reading to find out. 

**DMart Growth Strategy**

The success story of DMart is owed to its investor and trader turned entrepreneur ‘Radhakishan Damani,’ Now you know what the D stands for in DMart.

Founded in 2002, the DMart retail chain is owned by Avenue Supermarts. It started off with only two stores in the state of Maharashtra and today boasts 220 stores and 225 DMart Ready stores across 11 states and 1 union territory. DMart was also one of the few companies whose shares were listed at almost a 114% premium post its IPO.

 What is DMart’s Business Model?

Product Mix: Have you ever examined the categories of products that are available in DMart? You would notice that they only sell those that fall in the category of Foods, Non-foods, and General Merchandise, Apparel, and other daily products. One may find this bizarre as retail chains also expand their product offerings to electronics, jewelry, etc.

Although DMart may fall short in terms of the number of stores it makes up for it in profitability. To put things in perspective in the FY 2014-15 Dmart booked profits of Rs. 211 crores beating both Reliance Retail and Future Retail which earned Rs. 159 crores and Rs. 153 crores.

DMart has done this to ensure that the products they sell are in demand throughout the year. Thus maintaining consistency in sales and lower shelf life. This also meets their targeted low and middle-class’s daily household needs. 

You may have observed that all the money saved through various strategies implemented were carried onto the customers further catapulting them to success. But another proponent that helped DMart was Damani’s investor mindset.

Being a value investor Damani gave importance to the long-term view. In hindsight, none of the strategies would have worked if they weren’t diligently applied over the long term.

Outlook & Valuation: Sandhar is continuously diversifying its product portfolio and expanding its customer base by offering high value added products and focusing on exports. In terms of valuations, the pre-issue P/E works out to 25x 1HFY2018 annualized earnings (at the upper end of the issue price band), which is lower compared to its closest peer Minda Corporation (trading at 30x its 1HFY2018 annualized earnings). Hence, considering the above positive factors, better ROE profile and reasonable valuations, we recommend SUBSCRIBE rating.

Company background 
Sandhar Technologies Ltd. is one of the leading auto component suppliers for safety and security systems such as lock assemblies, mirror assemblies, operator cabins for 2W, PV and off-highway vehicles. Currently, 2W, PV & CV and off highway contribute ~58%, 30%, and 9% respectively to its revenue. The company has 21 product categories and 31 manufacturing facilities in India, 2 in Spain, 1 in Mexico and 5 are in the process of getting commissioned in India. Going ahead, Sandhar would focus more on offering high value added products like rearparking sensors, ABS/CBS, Tyre-pressure monitor, etc. coupled with expansion in the customer base and increase the wallet share from the existing OEM customers. Company is also working towards auto fuels and emission norms and expanding exports portfolio.

Issue details 
Sandhar’s Technologies Ltd. IPO is a mix of offer-for-sale and fresh issue of shares. The fresh issue would constitute of shares worth `300cr, with offer-for-sale of 0.64cr shares. The company will dilute 15% of its post-offer paid-up equity share capital.

Objectives of the Offer 
•	Repayment or prepayment in full, or in part of certain loans availed by the company (`225cr) 
•	General corporate purposes

Key Risks
•	Slowdown in 2W/PV/Commercial vehicle industries could impact the overall sales volume of the company 
•	Increase in competition from other players can impact the company’s business

What I’d prefer are practical and steady ideas that can help grow my savings while keeping risks under control.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"*How India 🇮🇳 is going to witness the Mother of all Bull Markets by 2035*? 
According to McKinsey, these 10 sectors are about to explode. 

Some by 6 to 10x in the next decade.

This is not just growth. 
This is history being written. 

Over the next few years.

India will add up to $5 trillion to its economy.

That’s like building another India inside the current one.

But this time it’s not just IT and outsourcing.

This time we’re building chips, rockets, energy and AI.

These 10 sectors are about to define India’s next decade.

👉 Sector 1 : EVs and Batteries (6 times growth)

India is already the third largest car market.

But electric vehicles are the next ₹40 lakh crore wave.

Tata, Ola and Mahindra are building the vehicles.

But the real money is in lithium, charging infra and battery recycling.

One startup here could power 10 cities.

👉 Sector 2 : AI Software and Services (5 times growth)

Every Indian IT firm is quietly turning into an AI firm.

Infosys, TCS and Zoho are just the tip.

The new wave? Indian AI tools for law, medicine, education and Bharat languages.

McKinsey says this space alone can add ₹16 lakh crore to India’s GDP.

👉 Sector 3 : E-commerce (4 times growth)

In 2014, India had 5 crore online shoppers.

In 2030, we’ll cross 60 crore.

And they won’t just be on Flipkart or Amazon.

They’ll shop through voice, WhatsApp, influencers and rural fintech.

The market is moving from English to Hinglish. From metros to mandis.

👉 Sector 4 : Semiconductors (3 times growth)

India is done being just the software guy.

Now we want to make the chip inside the device.

Tata, Vedanta and Micron are setting up fabs with up to 50 percent government support.

If this clicks, India won’t just be assembling iPhones. We’ll be designing their brains.

👉 Sector 5 : Space (4 times growth)

This is no longer just ISRO.

In 2023 alone, over 100 space startups emerged in India.

From launching satellites to building reusable rockets, India is now SpaceX at one-tenth the cost.

The global demand for low-cost launches is sky-high. And India is ready to supply.

👉 Sector 6 : Nuclear Fission (5 times growth)

Sounds futuristic. But the future is now.

India needs 24 times more clean energy by 2047.

Nuclear is compact, zero-carbon and reliable.

And new-age reactors like SMRs are being quietly explored by giants like Reliance.

👉 Sector 7 : Renewable Energy and Storage (3 times growth)

India aims for 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030.

But solar panels and windmills are useless without storage.

This is where battery parks, hydrogen and pumped hydro come in.

Storage is the backbone of the green revolution.

👉 Sector 8 : Bio-to-X Technologies (3 times growth)

India generates over 75 crore tonnes of biomass every year.

That’s not waste. That’s fuel, packaging, electricity and even jet fuel.

Startups are converting crop residue into high-value exports.

Biotech is not just pharma anymore. It’s bio-everything.

👉 Sector 9 : Biopharma (4 times growth)

India already supplies 60 percent of the world’s vaccines.

But now we want to invent them too. 

From AI-based drug discovery to high-end biologics, Indian pharma is going from generic to genius.

This sector alone could become bigger than the entire IT industry in a decade.

👉 Sector 10 : Cybersecurity (2.5 times growth)

In 2023, India faced over 9 lakh cyber attacks.

As UPI, healthtech and govtech scale, data threats will multiply.

India is already building its own digital fortress.

Startups are creating India-specific tools for detection, prevention and recovery.

These 10 sectors could generate over 10 crore jobs.

They will define our IPOs, our exports, our college degrees and even our politics.

The next 25 years won’t be services led. They’ll be innovation led. 

India is not just growing. 

It is transforming into the world’s biggest bull market.",1756034317.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1mysyk4/how_india_is_going_to_witness_the_mother_of_all/

Took a lot of courage to post and ask about this

I earn around ₹60,000 per month. Out of this, I give ₹10,000 to my mother every month and have a recurring deposit (RD) of ₹21,000 that’s set to expire in December 2025.

Confused about continuing my RD or diverting funds to SIPs — need insights on building a better long-term investment plan

I started trading and investing last year, but like most beginners, I made a lot of mistakes early on. I used to buy stocks that were already gaining in price, thinking I’d make quick profits — but that mindset completely messed up my portfolio and made my investments scattered with no clear direction.

Now I’m trying to rebuild my investing approach and focus more on long-term and structured investing through SIPs. That’s why I’m considering either stopping or reducing my RD to ₹10,000–₹15,000 per month and diverting the remaining amount into SIPs.

Currently, my monthly SIP plan looks like this:

Parag Parikh Flexi Cap: ₹5,000–₹6,000

HDFC Midcap Opportunities: ₹2,000–₹3,000

Bandhan Small Cap: ₹1,500–₹2,000

I’ve also been fortunate enough to get recommended from various people in reddit to go through Zerodha Varsity, which will help me understand a lot of the basics around market behavior, mutual funds, and stock investing.

A few questions for the experienced investors here:

1. When you identify a certain stock, how do you decide how much amount to invest in it?


2. Suppose you already hold a stock that’s in profit, and someone else (or even you) keeps accumulating that stock monthly — won’t your profit percentage gradually reduce as your average buy price goes up, even if the stock continues performing well?
I hope that question makes sense — please pardon me if it sounds too noobish!


3. How do you identify fundamentally strong long-term stocks worth holding for 5–10 years?


4. Does it make sense to occasionally do swing trades to earn extra money and use those profits to step up SIP amounts gradually?

Lastly, I’m also thinking about withdrawing my existing stock holdings (which are mostly short-term and unplanned buys) and reinvesting that amount into long-term quality stocks or mutual funds for better compounding.

Would really appreciate insights, suggestions, or even personal experiences from others who’ve gone through a similar phase of transitioning from random stock picking to structured investing.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"[IPO Analysis] EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd. Hey folks,

I started [helloquant ](https://helloquant.in/)as a side project. Will talk about it later in details. One thing I realized is for IPO, there is no good website which is clean and give analysis in a straight forward manner. So, we are starting an IPO Analysis Series where we look at upcoming Indian IPOs through a **quantitative lens** — no fluff, just data, valuations, risks, and context.

Our first breakdown is on **EPack Prefab Technologies Ltd.** (incorp 1999), a company in the business of pre-engineered steel buildings and prefabricated structures. They also manufacture EPS (thermocol) blocks, sheets, and packaging products.

# 📌 IPO Details

* **Price Band**: ₹194–204
* **Issue Size**: ₹504 Cr (Fresh ₹300 Cr + OFS ₹204 Cr)
* **Current GMP**: \~₹20
* **Use of Proceeds**: Capex, working capital, debt repayment

# 📊 Financial Highlights

* Revenue CAGR: **31.4%** (highest among peers)
* PAT growth: **57%**
* ROE: **22.69%** | ROCE: **22.88%**
* EBITDA Margin: **10%+**

# 🔎 Valuation vs Peers

Peers: PENIND, INTERARCH, EVERESTIND, BEARDSELL

* **P/E** = 34.54 (rich vs peers)
* **ROE** = 22.7% (highest among peers)
* **WC Days** = 35 (very efficient)

# 🧮 Strengths

* Strong presence in a growing prefab construction market
* Diversified product mix (buildings + EPS)
* Expanding capacity with IPO proceeds
* Fastest revenue growth among peers

# ⚓ Anchors & Analyst Views

* Anchor investors include **WhiteOak, 360One, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley**
* Positive recommendations from **Reliance Securities, SBI Securities**

# ⚠️ Risks

* Volatility in raw material prices (steel dependency)
* Execution risks in expansion
* Competition from larger, established players

# 💡 Our Take

At the upper band, valuations look **expensive on P/E basis**, but strong ROE, efficient working capital, and anchor participation show confidence. Might be interesting for listing gains, but medium/long-term depends on execution.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Automation Boosts Consistency in Indian Stock Market Trading Hey guys, I have curated some news articles for my trading setup today. Here are some interesting developments:

1. Premier Energies and JSW Holdings are among six stocks currently showing a bullish RSI upswing. I'm looking at these for potential entries if the bullish momentum sustains.

2. Nazara Technologies is approaching its record date for a 1:1 bonus issue and a 1:2 stock split. This could increase liquidity and attract more retail investors; I'm considering a closer analysis to see if it aligns with my algo setups.

3. Quest Global might sell up to 6% of its holdings to raise over $200 million. Such moves often influence market sentiment, and I might short if there's a significant dip post-announcement.

4. Jinkushal Industries has secured Rs 35 crore from anchor investors ahead of its IPO. IPOs can be volatile, but they also offer opportunities; I'll be watching this one to see how it performs.

5. TruAlt Bioenergy has raised Rs 252 crore via anchor book ahead of its IPO. Similar to Jinkushal, this could be an opportunity for a quick trade depending on the initial market response.

I use daily news to scan potential stocks, and if they fall into my algo setups, I take the trade. Curious if anyone else does this.",1758771939.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1npwoun/automation_boosts_consistency_in_indian_stock/

# What I’m hoping to learn

I want to invest ₹50K–₹60K/month for long-term wealth building. I'm looking for advice on:

* Which SIPs or portfolios seem redundant or unnecessary
* How I can better diversify across large/mid/small caps and debt
* Striking the right balance between safety and growth
* Tax efficiency: I follow the new tax regime, but how do I manage LTCG better?
* Whether my current global exposure (via INDmoney) is enough or should be improved
* Any personal finance advice you might have for me (can be other than investments as well).

The company seems to be scaling up, they are making profits, they’re involved in major renewable energy projects and recently awarded a contract worth over ₹900 crore to a Mumbai-based firm. They’re also planning an IPO soon, which usually signals growth.

M19 College student here. Have got into investing since last week of July. (I have seperate money kept aside for leisure expenses and upskilling requirements)

Made few hundred rupees of profit in Datamatics Stock just after starting but daily monitoring was quite hectic since then I have planned to hold stocks for long term gains (Over 3 years of horizon).

Few questions I have:

* **Have almost 3K in Gold and 2.5K in Silver as hedge.**
   * Is the Silver-Gold allocation too much defensive for long term for a young invester with long term in mind ? Invested into Gold/Silver as they are generally said to be stable and generally have been safe bet for long term growth with low volatility in bad markets.
* **Advice on stock holdings.**
   * Is large allocation to BSE safe bet ? Ik 2 stocks wont make difference but I wanted to invest in MII stocks since they are said to be good investments for long horizon and 2400-2500 seems okayish entry point for it.
   * What is the outlook on BSE since NSE IPO can be out anytime by year end or so. Since NSE is trading at about 2100 in unlisted market (saw article about it on reddit) will BSE go down to match it or will BSE hold its ground near 2400 levels.
   * Looking to double down and invest more money to have 10 stocks each of ITC and Coal India & 5 stocks of Bajaj Finance by year end. Are the above three stocks (Bajaj Finance, Coal India, ITC) at good entry points as of now ?

**Fundamental Strategy**: Will have only BSE, Bajaj Finance, ITC, Coal India shares with no further intentions to add other stocks since capital is small. No quick profit booking in mind. Ready to hold for 3 Years + with averaging in between if markets go considerably down. Will add more capital with targets of doubling quantity in next few years. Will not add more Gold/Silver ETFs since 5.5K allocation seems fine till 50K mark. May add one small cap bullish stock once in a while to experiment with playing with stocks (As of now, have Zuari Agro Chem).

Looking forward to hear any other opinions on above stocks or strategy.",1755236214.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketIndia/comments/1mqops6/allocation_strategy_and_stock_review_college/

Just came to notice after the current NSDL IPO that I sold yesterday.

I got alloted 103 share of Mazagon Dock IPO in 2020 at Rs.145.

If you do the calculation.

After the split each share with a face value of ₹10 into two shares of ₹5 each.

So I would have had 206 share of Mazagon Dock.

At the peak it went to Rs.3750 * 206

Value would have been Rs. 7.7 Lakh

I am referring to established names like:

* NSE (National Stock Exchange) - up nearly 30% YoY in the unlisted space
* Tata Capital - gaining solid investor interest

But before you get carried away, let me be clear, this is not meant for retail investors.

Unlisted shares are highly risky and illiquid. They're typically suited for HNIs and UHNIs who have access to deep networks, extensive due diligence, and the financial muscle to handle potential losses.

Here are two key red flags to watch out for:

* Lack of liquidity - You might not find a buyer when you want to sell
* [Post-IPO](https://web.stockedge.com/ipo?section=listed-ipo) lock-in - Even after listing, there's a 6-month lock-in period for unlisted investors

Unless you are well-informed and financially resilient, the risks in unlisted shares can far outweigh the potential rewards.

I'm currently studying a few cases purely from a research perspective..

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"PhonePe Initiates IPO Preparations, Eyes $15 Billion Valuation. PhonePe, India’s preeminent digital payments platform, has formally commenced groundwork for its forthcoming initial public offering (IPO), in a move that underscores the accelerating maturation of the country's fintech sector. According to sources cited by PTI, the company has engaged four prominent global investment banks—Kotak Mahindra Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley—to advise on and underwrite the offering.

Currently valued at approximately $12 billion, PhonePe is reportedly aiming to raise $1.5 billion through the IPO, a capital influx that could elevate its valuation to around $15 billion. The proposed listing marks a significant milestone not only for the company but also for India’s broader digital economy, which has seen rapid expansion on the back of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) framework.

The company is expected to file its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) by August, with the public listing anticipated before the close of the calendar year.

This development arrives amid a global recalibration of tech valuations and investor sentiment, yet reflects continued confidence in the growth trajectory of Indian digital finance infrastructure. PhonePe's market leadership in UPI transactions and diversified financial services portfolio position it favorably to capitalize on both domestic retail participation and institutional interest.

Recently starting my investing journey in last 6 months. Please review my stock picks.  
The reason for picking this stocks are

BSE - Large exchange and monopoly ( even NSE IPO comes it will become duopoly, so there is a value in future)  
CDSL - Large depository ( even NSDL IPO comes it will become duopoly, and new investors are going to increase, so there is a value in future)  
GOLDIETF - ICICI prudential gold etf, this is basically a gold etf, I picked it because it has good AUM and decent expense ratio.  
ITC - Largest player and gives dividends

Apart from this Im investing in the below mutual funds as well  
Zerodha Largemidcap 250 Index fund - Picked this fund because wanted to invest in Index fund and this provides a mix with Nifty 50, Nifty next 50 and midcap 150  
\- Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund - Picked this fund because wanted to invest in a flexi cap which has some global stock exposure

Im not going to touch these investment for atleast 8 years ( ideally 10+ years).  
Currently Im not doing any SIP, whenever I feel comfortable and I see a better entry point I just buy the stocks and mutual funds with 10 or 15K in lumpsum.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Why I Believe Ather Energy Will Be a Multibagger Hey Folks, I’ve been diving deep into Ather Energy since their IPO hit the scene in April 2025, and I’m convinced this EV two-wheeler (E2W) company has the potential to be a multibagger over the next 5-10 years. Here’s my take on why Ather could deliver massive returns for long-term investors. Buckle up, this is gonna be a detailed ride!


1. Riding the Electric Vehicle Megatrend in India  
India’s EV market is on fire, and Ather is perfectly positioned to capitalize. The Indian E2W market is projected to grow to 10–12 million units annually by FY31, driven by rising fuel costs, government incentives, and increasing environmental awareness. Ather, as the fourth-largest E2W manufacturer in India (behind Ola Electric, TVS, and Bajaj), already commands a 10.6% market share in FY24, with ambitions to hit 20% in the near term. 

Unlike traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) scooters, EVs offer lower running costs—think ₹600 in electricity vs. ₹5,200 in fuel for a petrol scooter over 80 km daily. Ather’s focus on premium, tech-laden scooters like the 450X and family-oriented Rizta appeals to both urban millennials and mass-market buyers, giving them a broad addressable market.

Why it matters: With government policies pushing for 30% EV penetration by 2030 and subsidies like FAME-III, Ather’s growth is backed by strong tailwinds. Their ability to scale volumes (42% YoY increase in FY25) shows they’re already gaining traction.


2. Innovation and Premium Positioning  
Ather isn’t just another EV maker—they’re the Apple of Indian E2Ws. Their scooters are packed with cutting-edge tech:  
- Smart features: Google Maps integration, multi-stop Trip Planner, Bluetooth connectivity, and Theft & Tow Alerts. 
- In-house R&D: With over 700 R&D employees and hundreds of patents, Ather designs critical components like motor controllers, dashboards, and battery packs in-house, ensuring quality and cost control.
- Ather Grid: They’ve built India’s largest EV two-wheeler fast-charging network, with 3,100+ charging points across 80+ cities, giving them a moat against competitors.

Their premium positioning sets them apart from budget players like Ola Electric, which often face quality complaints. Posts on X and Reddit rave about Ather’s build quality, ride experience, and service, with users calling it “the king in the south.” Ather’s ability to tap both the premium (450X, Apex) and mass-market (Rizta) segments gives them pricing power and scalability.

Why it matters: Ather’s tech-first approach and brand loyalty mirror companies like Tesla in their early days. As EVs become mainstream, their premium scooters will likely command higher margins, boosting profitability.

3. Financials Improving, Path to Profitability  
Yes, Ather is loss-making (₹1,059.7 Cr net loss in FY24), but the numbers tell a promising story.  
- Revenue growth: FY24 revenue was ₹1,789.1 Cr, and FY25 saw a 29% rise in total income.  
- Margin improvement: Adjusted Gross Margin doubled to 19% in FY25, and EBITDA margin improved from -34% to -23%. 
- Cost optimization: Ather’s new Rizta model has 7% lower Bill of Materials (BOM) costs, and their upcoming Factory 3.0 in Maharashtra will boost capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws annually, driving economies of scale. 

Their IPO proceeds (₹2,626 Cr fresh issue) will fund R&D, manufacturing expansion, and marketing, reducing reliance on external debt. Plus, their asset-light distribution model (third-party experience and service centers) keeps overheads low.

Why it matters: Multibaggers often start as loss-making companies with high growth potential. Ather’s improving margins and strategic investments mirror early-stage tech giants that turned profitable as they scaled.


4. Strong Backing and Market Confidence  
Ather’s investor lineup reads like a who’s who of Indian business:  
- Hero MotoCorp owns a 38%+ stake, providing industry expertise and financial muscle.
- Sachin Bansal (Flipkart founder) has poured in millions, signaling long-term confidence.
- NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund) invested $71M in 2024, pushing Ather to unicorn status ($1B valuation).  

Their IPO was a hit, with retail investors and institutions showing strong interest, despite some skepticism about the $2.5B valuation. Posts on X highlight Ather’s “impressive” scale and market share, reflecting positive sentiment.

Why it matters: Backing from heavyweights like Hero and NIIF reduces financial risk and signals Ather’s credibility. Hero’s distribution network could also supercharge Ather’s reach in Tier 2/3 cities.

5. Competitive Edge in a Crowded Market
The E2W space is heating up, with Ola Electric, TVS, Bajaj, and even Honda in the mix. But Ather has distinct advantages:  
- Quality over quantity: Unlike Ola, which faces criticism for poor quality and service, Ather’s scooters are praised for reliability and performance.  
- Niche focus: Ather targets urban, tech-savvy buyers and families, avoiding direct price wars with budget brands.  
- Charging infrastructure: Ather Grid’s 3,100+ fast chargers give them an edge over competitors with limited networks.

While reliance on imported components (e.g., from China) and government subsidies pose risks, Ather’s in-house manufacturing and vertical integration mitigate these.

Why it matters: In a competitive market, Ather’s focus on quality, tech, and infrastructure creates a defensible moat, positioning them to outpace rivals as the market consolidates.

Risks to Consider
No investment is a slam dunk, and Ather has challenges:  
- Profitability timeline: Losses may persist for a few years as they invest in growth.
- Competition: Ola’s aggressive pricing and Bajaj’s Chetak are formidable threats.  
- Valuation concerns: Some Reddit users called the IPO’s $2.5B valuation “frothy” compared to the $1.3B valuation in a pre-IPO round.
- External risks: Supply chain disruptions or changes in government subsidies could hurt margins. 

That said, multibaggers are rarely “safe” bets. The key is Ather’s ability to execute, and their track record—scaling to 109,577 units in FY24 and 107,983 in 9M FY25—shows they can deliver.


Why Ather Could Be a Multibagger
Multibaggers often share these traits: a growing market, innovative products, improving financials, and strong management. Ather checks all these boxes:  
- Market growth: India’s E2W market is set to explode, and Ather’s 10.6% share is just the start.  
- Innovation: Their tech and charging network set them apart.  
- Financial trajectory: Doubling gross margins and reducing losses show a clear path to profitability.  
- Leadership: Founders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain have built Ather from a startup to a unicorn, backed by industry giants.  

If Ather captures 20% market share by FY30 (as CEO Tarun Mehta targets) and turns profitable, their revenue could multiply, driving the stock price to 5x–10x returns. Compare this to early Tesla or even Indian multibaggers like Eicher Motors, which rode the premium two-wheeler wave.

My Strategy
I’m bullish on Ather for the long haul (5–10 years). I’ve allocated a small portion of my portfolio to their stock, treating it as a high-risk, high-reward bet. I’ll monitor their quarterly results, especially volume growth, margin expansion, and Factory 3.0’s progress. If the stock dips due to market volatility, I’ll consider averaging down, as EV stocks can be volatile in their early years.


TL;DR
Ather Energy is a premium EV two-wheeler maker with a 10.6% market share, strong innovation, and a growing charging network. Despite current losses, their 42% volume growth, doubling gross margins, and backing from Hero MotoCorp and NIIF make them a compelling long-term bet. With India’s E2W market set to boom, Ather has the potential to be a 5x–10x multibagger for patient investors.  

What do you folks think? Bullish on Ather, or are the risks too high? Let’s discuss! 👇

Although the upi app should not give any other bank account option but paytm did that's why fuck you paytm.

Context: my mother's bank is linked with my number.

So, after this mandate has been made from my bank account i got a new mandate request in phonepe app for vishal again then i figured out that i messed up then i rejected vishal application(mother's A/C) and reapplied from groww app now used phonepe for it.


Main thing: When checked in BSE website through mother's PAN the cancelled application appeared and my current valid application number is different from it. When checked in kfintech website both application appeared when checked specifically from application number but cancelled one was blank just the application number and securities is shown and BSE doesn't recognise my current valid application and also BSE doesn't show that it's cancelled or something it shows it's like valid as you can see in the pictures above.

P.S. : My both application of same ipo last 3 digits is same so don't be confused i can't show full number here.

So, my main question is as i didn't get allotment was it because of this shit or i wasn't unlucky although my application was not rejected.

What do you think about this please share your thoughts..

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"International Gemmological Institute Limited - Diamonds or Dust? International Gemmological Institute (IGI) is the largest diamond and jewelry certifying body in India with ~50% MS in India and ~33% global market share.

IGI is the second largest diamond certifying body after GIA, who created the modern grading of Diamonds (i.e. - 4C’s - Colour, Cut, Carat and Clarity). GIA on the other hand has over ~50% global market share with a substantial market share in USA.

IGI has the first mover advantage in grading Lab-grown Diamonds (LGD’s) where they have 65% market share.

IGI -

IGI has 3 entities - India, Belgium and Netherlands. Belgium and Netherlands entities were acquired post IPO for a consideration of ~155 million USD (~1300 crores).

India is the largest entity contributing over 80% of revenues and 95% of EBITDA in CY24, whereas Belgium and Netherlands have a smaller contribution.

98% of revenues comes from certifications and accreditions whereas 2 percent comes from training and education.

Certifications costs at 3-5 percent at wholesale level. Broadly certification cost are at 1000 rupee per report.

IGI’s unique proposition and asset light model results in over 73% EBITDA Margins and ~100% ROCE, amongst the top 1% company in India and globally in terms of margins and capital allocation.

IGI India -

IGI India caters to Top 9/10 jewelry chains in India ( except Tanishq which does in-house)

IGI certifies Natural Diamond, Lab Grown Diamonds, Jewelry and colored stones.



Margins for the company across segments are LGD > Natural Diamonds > Jewelry and Colored Stones

Margin profile in Domestic is at 72-73% EBITDA margins.

IGI overseas operations -

IGI has 2 subsidiaries - Belgium and Netherlands.

Belgium entities overseas Belgium and USA whereas Netherlands entity overseas Netherlands, China, Hong-Kong, Middle-East and other countries.

Currently, the overseas entities operate at a sub-optimal level resulting in operating margins at ~10% v/s India margins at 72-73% EBITDA margins.



Growth Indicators -

Growth in Lab-grown Diamonds -

From CY21-24, IGI grew on back of strong LGD growth at 30% CAGR in volumes and 29% / 34% / 37% in Revenue / EBITDA / PAT.

In-terms of diamond production 18% of total diamonds produced are now Lab-grown v/s 9% in 2019.

Lab-grown Diamonds boom has been led by limited product differentiation, product affordability and newer generations adoption.

The entire longer term thesis for IGI can be on the back of what thesis you subscribe to -

LGD continuing to replace Diamond market

Price Erosion in LGD making it a differentiated market v/s LGD.

Natural Diamonds losing their shine ?

Diamonds were meant to be forever, but with the exodus of LGD and affordable jewelry, will LGD replace and destroy diamonds forever or will the mighty old diamond make a comeback?

Natural Diamond Industry declined by 2.4 billion USD (~8% in CY23) with 50% decline led by wider adoption of LGD’s.



Natural Diamonds have also lost their ability as store of value with prices down ~40% from peak.



According to De Beers, among the world’s largest natural diamond company, the below chart shows supply coming down materially as natural diamond miners continue to try and artificially inflate prices below.



Lab-grown Diamonds have replaced a part of Natural Diamonds due to better affordability but lab grown diamonds pricing has seen a steep decline with a price correction of over 60% in CY24.



The steep decline in LGD poses challenges to IGI’s certification pricing and further declines in LGD prices cannot be ruled out owing to better manufacturing capabilities driving down prices further.

IGI had to drop prices in April-May of it’s certifications because of drop in LGD prices resulting in volume-pricing impact which is expected to continue for next 2 quarters.

While pricing has remained relatively stable over the last 9-10 months, any further sharp pricing decline can de-rail IGI’s growth trajectory.



The need for certification -

IGI is in a sweet spot where certification need is only rising for both natural and LGD with certification companies being disproportionate winners in the fight between Natural Diamonds and Lab-grown Diamonds.

With rise in LGD’s, the need for certification for natural diamonds is on the rise, with differentiation being one of the key selling points for natural diamonds

Lab-grown diamonds are on a nascent stage, where LGD certification is following Natural Diamond certification to separate it from lower end jewelry such as one with American Diamonds.

Key risks
-The key risk for IGI is a steep drop in LGD prices which makes certification costs unviable. 

Overseas subsidiaries have performed poorly in CY24 and if these entities don’t turn-around they will be a drag on both profitability and margins in the years to come.Margin headwinds especially in India is likely as the company is adding employees in order to cater to volumes increasing.Conclusion - IGI’s competitive advantages, unparalleled financial economics and strong presence in a fast growing segment makes it an interesting business to evaluate.

However with the ever-evolving LGD segment and sharp pricing fluctuations, it can easily turn tailwind into a headwind especially historically highest margins.

Whether IGI will benefit from LGD boom is a question mark at the moment. Only time will tell.

I'll give you an idea of the MO, they'll give you stock ideas, they'll give you profits. This gains your trust. Usually it's two types of stocks, either stocks that have sureshot market predictions to raise or rally, ie, absolutely strong fundamentals. Or they'll give you stocks that are sooooo small that it's easy to manipulate and pump them with their scam money.

Once you see it working, you'll be given a golden opportunity to join their ""Institutional Investor Account"" which will be shown as the holy grail of investment. As per them, it's the secret of investing. This is how the big people make money in reality. It'll be either an apk or a fake website with a stock market interface designed into it. You'll add money to it, it'll show in it, and they'll allot shares and even IPO allotments to you. (Obviously it's not real, it's a fake interface and the money is going to their accounts) And then you'll make profits, but when you go onto withdraw profits, you'll be kicked out and lose all access to the accounts as well as their ""exclusive investor"" services.

We have developed some algorithms using AI models to help us avoid bad investments.*

Hi,

Our motto is to help Retail Investors including ourselves: **#avoidbadinvestments**

In this post we are going to explore 3 stocks where Big Bulls has invested today.

1. **Kabra Extrusion Technik Ltd.**

Biz. Sustainability Rate is low at 6% which reflects in their recent Sales Growth: **-9%.** However its recent EPS growth is at 13%. Target drops to 433 INR.

2. **Senores Pharmaceuticals Ltd.** (Recent IPO). Due to recent IPO not enough reliable public data is available. Recent Biz. Sustainability Rate is good at 32%, although ROCE dipped a bit to 12%. Biz. numbers are not convincing. Target is subjective to market conditions. **Hence too soon to invest for retail investors.**

3. **Avonmore Capital & Management Ltd**. Target is calculated at 15. Meaning there is no safety margin for retail investors  (15-18)/18 = **-16% (minus).** Ideally this safety margin should be >> 30% for retail investors to invest.

Hope this helps.

We also track big bulls investment and run the AI model on those to identify growth stocks.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Big Bulls Investment Alerts | 26-Dec-2024 | More than 10 Crores | EP2 In this post we found 2 more stocks where Big Bulls put in more than 10 Crores each today.

They are GPT Infraprojects and Mobikwik Systems. Although both of the stocks has raised few alerts and the business number doesn't provide enough confidence.

For GPT infraprojects: Business Sustainability Rate is just 4%. Although last year it was -5%. This should be more than its Sales Growth to sustain itself. Although recent sales growth is 25%, but it is due to debt. 

For Mobikwik Systems: The business sustainability is in deep red: -901%. Big alert here. and recent EPS growth is -117%.

Hence one should be very cautious with these two stocks.

What do you think? 

We check 3 things based on 5 years, 3 years and recent quarters. We do it only after some Big Bulls added more of that stock. We don’t use any other screeners.

1. PE growth momentum.
2. EPS growth momentum.
3. Business Sustainability Rate of last 10 years and recent quarters.

Using this 3 we calculate Intrinsic Values. Intrinsic value should be atleast 30% higher than current market price.

Reddit,current infraprojects ipo,"Highlights of PPFAS unit holders meet 2024^ We had a productive meeting with the [PPFAS Mutual Fund](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ppfas-mutual-fund/) team, which included [Rajeev Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-thakkar-715b3b1b1/), [Raunak Onkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raunakonkar/), [Neil Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-parikh-465b98187/), [Raj Mehta, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-mehta-cfa-8b8630a1/), [Rukun Tarachandani, CFA, CQF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rukun-tarachandani-cfa-cqf-19765518/) & [Mansi Kariya, CFA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-kariya-cfa/). Here are the highlights:  
  
Ø Achieving financial goals > beating benchmarks  
Ø Investment success is driven by asset allocation and compounding duration over individual stock/scheme selection  
Ø Midcap starts at 80k cr market cap and small-cap at 25k crore - no concerns regarding PPFAS Flexi Cap AUM  
Ø 4.5 lakh crores are invested in thematic/sectoral funds  
Ø No update from RBI on overseas investments. This question is asked to new governor now  
Ø Optimistic on India, but cautious due to high valuations. 80% invested but maintain 20% cash  
Ø Promoters are selling stakes (e.g., Whirlpool, Hyundai, LG, Walmart in Flipkart), while QIP activity and PE exits increase. Retail investors focus on SIPs, while promoters find value in QIPs  
Ø Okay to lose 50% of clients through redemptions than losing 50% of clients’ money by doing foolish things on investment side  
Ø Exposure to AI through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Solar exposure is via transmission companies  
Ø Conservative Hybrid Funds cap equity at 25%. DAAF has a minimum of 35% equity. CHF taxation is as per slab rates, while DAAF offers LTCG benefits beyond 2 years. CHF can invest in REITs/InvITs; DAAF cannot  
Ø Rising investments in small-cap, mid-cap, thematic funds, AIFs, PMS, and smallcases explain their resilience in current market relative to large companies  
Ø BSE was a miss. Thought NSE would be a dominant player, but BSE made a remarkable comeback. Participated through CDSL.  
Ø Maruti (PF stock) – Only a pure four-wheeler play (others have commercial vehicle, investments in other subsidiary) – tracking M&M, Tata motors too. Maruti have missed on SUV, EV front but its fine – as technologies are still evolving  
Ø Sold UTI AMC & Bajaj Auto due to valuations. Question on capital markets – due to new IND AS, earnings volatility has increased a lot. Capital market business is inherently volatile and IND AS have made them more. Run up in stocks has gone up – so trimmed/sold  
Ø ITC – Not as attractive as it was when we bought. Still reasonable valued now. On ITC Hotels – demerged and asset-light  
Ø Overall investment returns are driven by three factors: Dividend yield, Earnings growth, P/E multiple (going up/steady/down)  
Ø Liquidity – to be looked from 2-3 factors in conjunction. First – how much of your investment strategy depends upon the churn (buy and hold ours). Second – Client concentration (less than 2% for our #1 client)  
Ø In India, perception has built up mid/small cap co.s will do well than large caps. In USA, its reverse. Not always true.  
Ø HDFC Bank being a biggie does not mean it’s at a disadvantage  
Ø Smaller AUM of PPFAS Tax saver does not give advantage to PPFAS Flexi. We follow the same approach. Just – no foreign stocks & arbitrage allowed. Tax saver – min. 80% invested all time. Flexi – 65%.

Ø PPFAS DAAF maintains a fixed income duration of 3.25–3.5 years  
Ø On government regulation – you cannot avoid this is probably any sector (pvt or public)  
Ø Exited Accelya Kale due to concerns over its parent’s product roadmap  
Ø Missed Nvidia. Fundamental assumption was wrong in this case.  
Ø Succession plan – we have alignment of interests. Financially: ESOPs, investments in PPFAS units, on the same page on strategy, organization moving forward. Built a relationship that has passed professional things.  
Ø Exploring a new asset class (10L min.) under evolving guidelines  
Ø No plans for the AMC IPO for next couple of years  
Ø On ESG: Governance – we consider this even before ESG was a thing. E & S part – neutral. Business is not black & white.  
Ø Real estate is difficult for conviction-led investing, but proxies look attractive. Book – Inside Real Estate by Sushil Sayal. Surprised if we buy any RE developer in next 3-6 months.  
Ø We do track momentum, factor based (volatility of business etc.). Models are built to identify long term trends  
Ø Hiring a financial advisor is one of the best investments.  
Ø A mistake is not where a stock price went down, or its good thing if it went up. These are an outcome. Process > Outcome.

Ø Not considering investment in China

Reddit,vikran ipo,"Stocks and Mutual fund Discussion I had been thinking for quite long and was sceptical to post and ask in this sub out of felling low and not having the confidence to post this as felt guilty to post and ask from what a mess I have made out of the money earned. Took a lot of courage to post and ask about this

I earn around ₹60,000 per month. Out of this, I give ₹10,000 to my mother every month and have a recurring deposit (RD) of ₹21,000 that’s set to expire in December 2025.

Confused about continuing my RD or diverting funds to SIPs — need insights on building a better long-term investment plan

I started trading and investing last year, but like most beginners, I made a lot of mistakes early on. I used to buy stocks that were already gaining in price, thinking I’d make quick profits — but that mindset completely messed up my portfolio and made my investments scattered with no clear direction.

Now I’m trying to rebuild my investing approach and focus more on long-term and structured investing through SIPs. That’s why I’m considering either stopping or reducing my RD to ₹10,000–₹15,000 per month and diverting the remaining amount into SIPs.

Currently, my monthly SIP plan looks like this:

Parag Parikh Flexi Cap: ₹5,000–₹6,000

HDFC Midcap Opportunities: ₹2,000–₹3,000

Bandhan Small Cap: ₹1,500–₹2,000

I’ve also been fortunate enough to get recommended from various people in reddit to go through Zerodha Varsity, which will help me understand a lot of the basics around market behavior, mutual funds, and stock investing.

A few questions for the experienced investors here:

1. When you identify a certain stock, how do you decide how much amount to invest in it?


2. Suppose you already hold a stock that’s in profit, and someone else (or even you) keeps accumulating that stock monthly — won’t your profit percentage gradually reduce as your average buy price goes up, even if the stock continues performing well?
I hope that question makes sense — please pardon me if it sounds too noobish!


3. How do you identify fundamentally strong long-term stocks worth holding for 5–10 years?


4. Does it make sense to occasionally do swing trades to earn extra money and use those profits to step up SIP amounts gradually?

Lastly, I’m also thinking about withdrawing my existing stock holdings (which are mostly short-term and unplanned buys) and reinvesting that amount into long-term quality stocks or mutual funds for better compounding.

Would really appreciate insights, suggestions, or even personal experiences from others who’ve gone through a similar phase of transitioning from random stock picking to structured investing.
