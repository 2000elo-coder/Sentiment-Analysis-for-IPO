Reddit,Jayesh Logistics Limited,"i know it's over diversified and the portfolio is shit, but i need suggestions [This portfolio has a story better than Pushpa 2 lol. So half of the stocks were suggested by a random dude on instagram and idk how but 99&#37; of the time, his suggestions were spot on. Apparently he was part of a trading company. I made crazy gains thru him, but I deleted my instagram account out of some personal reasons. After that I decided to start my own research and few of the stocks are result of my research. My first bet was Zomato which went really really well. So instead of consolidating the existing companies, I started buying new shares. I agree this was a dumb decision. Then I got busy in my exams and didn't have much time to research. So I bought shares just on the company's name. Some of these shares are Mahindra Logistics, Paras, Exide Industries, TVS Supply Chain and others. As you can see, most of them did decently well. Then I applied for Hyundai IPO with literally zero research. I thought since it's a big IPO of a big company, it'll eventually go up. I know, again a dumb decision, but here we are. Now the problem is, I can't figure out which ones to hold and which one to sell. As of now, I don't have time to research all of them. I will start studying finance & stock market soon, as it is included in my syllabus, but it'll start after 4-5 months. Until then I wanted a starting point regarding my portfolio. Those who have experience, what are the immediate red flags you've noticed? What suggestions do you have for me?\(other than to learn stock market lol\) Also, this is just 66&#37; of my total portfolio. The rest 34&#37; is in mutual funds with XIRR of 20.40&#37;. The total portfolio's XIRR is 22.05&#37;. Any input would be highly appreciated. Thanks!](https://preview.redd.it/nnhebzflmy7e1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7566927834d472c1af056754091316c600f7dfb)",1734682242.0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1hif71i/i_know_its_over_diversified_and_the_portfolio_is/
Reddit,Jayesh Logistics Limited,"Stallion India Fluorochemicals IPO 1. Company fundamentals

Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited, established in 2002, specializes in the sale of refrigerant, industrial gases, and other related fluorochemical products.

The company's primary business includes debulking, blending, and processing refrigerant and industrial gases, offering products such as pre-filled cans and small cylinders/containers.

Between FY 22 and FY 24, Stallion India Fluorochemicals reported an average three-year Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of approximately 20% and 26%, respectively. The net profit registered a sharp rise of 51.6% year-on-year (YoY) from ₹9.75 crore in FY 23 to ₹14.78 crore in FY 24.

The company also has multiple manufacturing facilities across India with 4 facilities located in Khalapur (Maharashtra), Ghiloth (Rajasthan), Manesar (Haryana) and Panvel (Maharashtra). 

2. Issue size and split

The size of the IPO is small at Rs. 199.45 crore and the minimum investment is Rs. 14,850 for retail investors.

The IPO has majority fresh issue of 1.79 crore shares aggregating to Rs 160.73 crores and Offer For Sale (OFS) component of 0.43 crore shares aggregating to Rs 38.72 crores.

This is a green flag since we know that the promoters are not offloading too many shares.

3. Brand name and experienced Management

Stallion is a prominent player in the flourochemicals market with 10% market share.

The company has a professional management and experienced leadership of the promoter Mr. Shazad Sheriar Rustomji.

He has a good understanding of supply chain logistics with over 3 decades of experience in the field of refrigerants and specialty chemicals.

4. Valuation

The company is fairly priced with a P/E ratio of 48x, based on FY24 earnings post the equity share issuance.

It is a small cap company with a market cap of around Rs. 714 crore

The  valuation is reasonable, given the company's past growth, future growth prospects, and the profitability of the company.

5. Clear Use of Proceeds

The proceeds from the IPO will be used to support increased working capital needs, fund capital expenditures for its semiconductor and specialty gas debulking and blending facilities in Maharashtra, finance capital expenditures for its refrigerant debulking and blending facility in Andhra Pradesh, and to cover general corporate expenses.

The company will also not receive any proceeds from the OFS, as those will go to the selling promoter after deducting offer-related expenses and applicable taxes.

6. Strong underwriting team

Reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO signal credibility and thorough due diligence.

Sarthi Capital Advisors is the sole book running leaf manager of the IPO, while Bigshare Services is the registrar for the issue.

7. QIB Subscription and Anchor Investors

Observe the subscription momentum throughout the application time to see how qualified investors respond to the issue since it shows that the IPO is considered to be worthy, by people more knowledgeable than retail investors.

On day 2 of the IPO, the QIB portion is undersubscribed with only 0.31x subscription showing lack of institutional buyers.

Anchor investors also showed less interest in the IPO with only six anchor investors in the anchor book namely Saint Capital Fund, Ashika Global Securities, Craft Emerging Market Fund, Mint Focussed Growth Fund, Ashika India Select Fund, and Leading Light Fund.

Verdict:

This IPO is balanced but mixed with both pros and cons, you can invest money according to your risk appetite.

But if you're specific about getting listing gains, it's suggested to watch the GMP till the closing of the IPO and then apply.",1737176683.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1i408ce/stallion_india_fluorochemicals_ipo/
